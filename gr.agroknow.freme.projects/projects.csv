The Bulgarian case study region in the project is presented by low-input farming in grasslands in the Rhodopi mountains. Preliminary selection of 16 low-input farms in Bulgaria for a detailed assessment of biodiversity indicators is carried out. The socio-economic components, environmental factors and partially management intensity have been outlined in order to find farms covering a reliable scale of low-input farming. Three main groups of factors and conditions are implemented for developing an appropriate model for scaling: general socio-economic factors, non-enterprise specific socio-economic conditions, enterprise specific socio-economic conditions. The summarized effect of evaluated factors and conditions is presented by the farm intensity index. The developed model allows preliminary differentiation of farms in three main groups of intensity. A reliable scaling of farms prior to detailed assessment of indicators for biodiversity in low-input grasslands has been confirmed scientifically.ags:ARN="BG2012000188" , 90980  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/90980_en.html , Biodiversity conservation is an urgent task for our society with special attention for grassland areas The EU FP7 research project BIOBIO - INDICATORS FOR BIODIVERSITY IN ORGANIC AND LOW-INPUT FARMING SYSTEMS aims at developing scientifically sound, useful and attractive biodiversity indicators for organic and low-input farming in Europe.

The tool, which implements the biophysical model EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) and data sources readily available for the member countries of EU25 is aimed to support decision making in EU environmental policy. It is an integrated part of the INSEA FP6-project (Integrated Sink Enhancement Assessment) focusing on modelling of carbon sequestration potentials and greenhouse gases emissions from agricultural land under different land use management, and land use changes. The analysis quantifies environmental impacts and potentials of converting conventional tillage systems (i.e. mouldboard ploughing) to reduced or minimum tillage systems. Impacts on soil organic carbon in the topsoil (0-30 cm) and crop yields are modelled for a time horizon of 10 years. The model predicts an average increase of soil organic carbon between 1.7 and 2.5 % for reduced tillage, and between 2.9 and 4.4 % for minimum tillage compared to a continuation of conventional tillage. The impact of alternative management systems on crop yields is modest negative with the highest impact for minimum tillage systems (9.9 % on average) and followed by reduced tillage (4.2 % on average). It is necessary to notice that the modelling of environmental impacts is based on rough, and in many cases insufficient data on landscape and its utilisation. However, it should illustrate how EU data sources could be integrated and processed to support environmental policy making in EU member states, and that further efforts in input data validation and processing are needed.ags:ARN="RS2012001489" , 87962  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/87962_en.html , There is an urgent need to study in Europe the plant exposure to mycotoxin risk due to the identification of new toxigenic species, the continuous evolution of species profile on the food crops and climate changes that influence the quality of level of toxigenic fungi colonization of plant hosts. In particular, Fusarium and Aspergillus problem in Europe has enormous importance; recent epidemics in wheat in some areas of Northern and Central Europe and in grape in southern Europe have brought this problem into focus again. This concern has driven many efforts at EU level aimed to harmonize strategies for mycotoxinreduction in food and feed chain. This is the target of a large collaborative project of four-year duration (MYCORED as acronym), that was approved within the European FP7- Food, Agriculture, and Biotechnologies Work Programmes (www.mycored.eu). MYCORED aims to develop strategic solutions for reducing mycotoxin contamination in major crops. Novel methodologies, efficient handling procedures and information/dissemination, and educational strategies are considered in a context of multidisciplinary integration of know-how and technology to reduce mycotoxin exposure worldwide. The direct involvement of ICPC countries (Argentina, Egypt, Russia, South Africa) and international organizations (CIMMYT, IITA) together with strong scientific alliances with international experts and national and international societies for mycotoxicology is a strong point of the project through sharing experiences and resources from several past/ongoing mycotoxin projects in a global context. Similarly, the International Society for Mycotoxicology (ISM) (http://www.mycotoxsociety. org) aims at increasing scientific knowledge concerning biology, chemistry and any sciences/disciplines related to mycotoxins and toxigenic fungi, through membership networking, scientific meetings, symposia, discussions, technical courses and publications. In this context, it would be extremely important that MYCORED and ISM develop a network of cooperation-interaction with the whole scientific community in order to contribute to the efforts for harmonizing both research and legislation on mycotoxins.ags:ARN="RS2012001489" , 97683  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/97683_en.html , There is an urgent need to study in Europe the plant exposure to mycotoxin risk due to the identification of new toxigenic species, the continuous evolution of species profile on the food crops and climate changes that influence the quality of level of toxigenic fungi colonization of plant hosts.

The decision making process underlying livelihood strategies, is sometimes regular and seasonal, and sometimes occasional and unexpected. This concept also stresses the importance of reducing vulnerability, enhancing environmental sustainability, and building on local strengths and priorities. It recognizes that rural households are active agents of change and pursue a range of livelihood strategies. The article used the results of the survey conducted within the Project Assessing the multiple Impacts of the Common Agricultural Policies CAP on Rural Economies CAP-IRE funded under FP7. The aim of this paper is to analyze and examine the impact of the development of CAP based on analysis of livelihood strategies of rural farm households. The ways strategies of making a living depend on the means. These are summarized in the so-called capital asset pentagon, or, as some call it, the livelihood platform. The capital assets normally mentioned for rural livelihoods are: physical capital, natural resources, financial capital, human capital and social capital. The analysis of the impact of CAP on the livelihood strategies of rural agricultural households was conducted in three areas: management of production factors in terms of own and rented arable land - natural resources, an analysis of employment - human capital and social capital. Livelihood outcomes result from livelihood strategies. Despite the declining share of employment in agriculture, agriculture remains an important source of income for many rural households, particularly in the poorest and most underdeveloped regions of new EU Member States. In this sense, the CAP impact on livelihood strategies of rural households.ags:ARN="CZ2013000076" , 96974  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96974_en.html , We assessed drought characteristics in the Republic of Moldova based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated from monthly precipitation data simulated by the Regional Climate Model RegCM3. The RegCM simulations were conducted at a horizontal resolution of 10 km in the framework of EU-FP6 project Central and Eastern Europe Climate Change Impact and Vulnerability Assessment (CECILIA). The domain was centered over Romania at 46 deg N, 25 deg E and included the Republic of Moldova. We validated the model ability to simulate monthly temperature and precipitation by comparing the model simulations forced by ERA40 with the observations from CRU TS2.0 dataset and station observations for the period 1961-1990. The RegCM simulations (control and scenario runs) forced with the ECHAM5 Global Circulation Model (GCM) have been corrected against the systematic errors induced by the GCM. After the bias correction, the annual cycle of temperature and precipitation is analyzed by comparing the model simulations conducted under A1B scenario for the periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 with the control run for the period 1961-1990. The characteristics of the drought for the current climate were assessed based on SPI calculated for 1-24 month lags from CRU dataset and station observations.

One of its tasks was to obtain basic information about the soil properties, which determine the resistance against air pollution. Because of no harmonized methodology, the results were only partially useful for the initial purpose. The European Parliament and Council Directive No. 2152/2003 on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions Forest Focus concentrates not only on forest protection against air pollution and forest fires, but also on the areas like soil research and biodiversity assessment. To close out this gap the European Commission supported launching in 2004 a joint international demonstration project BioSoil, which was aimed to provide a harmonized soil and biodiversity studies of the EU Member States. The major project objective regarding the soils was to obtain statistically reliable information about the forest soil properties, which is necessary to deal with a number of environmental issues, like acidification and or eutrophication, dynamics of the carbon content of soil, climate change, etc.; to develop standardized and harmonized soil monitoring methodology (ICP Forests Guides and other guidance); to improve quality of the existing European forest soil database; and to identify and explain as far as possible temporal changes in forest soils. Statistical inventory of forest soils involved sampling forest soils from 0 to 80 cm deep, including the humus (O) horizon. In Latvia, the BioSoil project involved 95 ICP Forests monitoring plots of Level 1, distributed across the country in a regular 16 x 16 km grid. The soil samples for composite sample analyses were taken from 1 m deep pits (8 per sample plot). As the ICP Forests soil sampling method provides, the composite samples were taken from Horizon O (if present), 0...10 cm, 10...20 cm, 20...40 cm and 40...80 cm deep. Two sets of composite samples were collected in each plot  one set of certain volume (24 x 100 cm3 from each layer from 0...80 cm deep, and 24 samples of certain area (100 cm2) from the humus layer for bulk density and texture analyses, and another set for chemical analyses. Soil samples were prepared for analyses according to LVS ISO 11464 Standard. Fine earth fraction of soil (? is less than 2 mm) was used for chemical and texture analyses according to LVS ISO 11464, 2005. For composite samples the following parameters were determined: texture according to LVS ISO 11277, 2000; pH in water extraction according to LVS ISO 10390, 2002; carbonate according to LVS ISO 10693: 1995, 1999, total carbon (C) according to LECO, 1987 and calculated organic carbon (Corg.); total nitrogen (Ntot.) according to LVS ISO 11261, 2002. All the results were validated according to the validity tables provided by the ICP Forests. Calculations of the carbon stock of forest soils were made separately for the organic soils and mineral soils, using average thickness of litter layer, density and organic carbon content. This article deals with the results of analyses for soil acidity, texture, organic (Corg.) and total nitrogen (Ntot). Within the scope of this study signifi cant differences were found in pH H2O, texture and concentration of nitrogen in O horizon, as well as in the organic and mineral soil layers in forest stands with different dominant species. There is a correlation between dominant specie, site index, and content of clay particles in soil. Spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) grows better in loamy soils (clay content 7...10%). Horizon O of forest soils is moderately to strongly acidic. The most acidic conditions were found in pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. Content of total nitrogen in Horizon O depends on species composition of the stand as well as on the origin of soil material (organic or mineral). The highest content of total nitrogen was found in spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) and pine stands in Horizon O, which overlays organic soil. In Latvia the content of organic carbon in soil (0...80 cm deep) and Horizon O in forest soils is 754 +- 185 mill. t. This means that organic carbon stock in soil is considerably higher than in living biomass and therefore soil is a highly important element of natural carbon sequestration and as such it should be monitored and protected at least with the same care as the living forest biomass.ags:ARN="LV2010000232" , 91218  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/91218_en.html , The first EC scale forest soil inventory was implemented in the late 1990s within the ICP Forest Initiative. One of its tasks was to obtain basic information about the soil properties, which determine the resistance against air pollution. Because of no harmonized methodology, the results were only partially useful for the initial purpose. The European Parliament and Council Directive No. 2152/2003 on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions Forest Focus concentrates not only on forest protection against air pollution and forest fires, but also on the areas like soil research and biodiversity assessment. To close out this gap the European Commission supported launching in 2004 a joint international demonstration project BioSoil, which was aimed to provide a harmonized soil and biodiversity studies of the EU Member States. The major project objective regarding the soils was to obtain statistically reliable information about the forest soil properties, which is necessary to deal with a number of environmental issues, like acidification and or eutrophication, dynamics of the carbon content of soil, climate change, etc.; to develop standardized and harmonized soil monitoring methodology (ICP Forests Guides and other guidance); to improve quality of the existing European forest soil database; and to identify and explain as far as possible temporal changes in forest soils. Statistical inventory of forest soils involved sampling forest soils from 0 to 80 cm deep, including the humus (O) horizon. In Latvia, the BioSoil project involved 95 ICP Forests monitoring plots of Level 1, distributed across the country in a regular 16 x 16 km grid. The soil samples for composite sample analyses were taken from 1 m deep pits (8 per sample plot). As the ICP Forests soil sampling method provides, the composite samples were taken from Horizon O (if present), 0...10 cm, 10...20 cm, 20...40 cm and 40...80 cm deep. Two sets of composite samples were collected in each plot  one set of certain volume (24 x 100 cm3 from each layer from 0...80 cm deep, and 24 samples of certain area (100 cm2) from the humus layer for bulk density and texture analyses, and another set for chemical analyses. Soil samples were prepared for analyses according to LVS ISO 11464 Standard. Fine earth fraction of soil (? is less than 2 mm) was used for chemical and texture analyses according to LVS ISO 11464, 2005. For composite samples the following parameters were determined: texture according to LVS ISO 11277, 2000; pH in water extraction according to LVS ISO 10390, 2002; carbonate according to LVS ISO 10693: 1995, 1999, total carbon (C) according to LECO, 1987 and calculated organic carbon (Corg.); total nitrogen (Ntot.) according to LVS ISO 11261, 2002. All the results were validated according to the validity tables provided by the ICP Forests. Calculations of the carbon stock of forest soils were made separately for the organic soils and mineral soils, using average thickness of litter layer, density and organic carbon content. This article deals with the results of analyses for soil acidity, texture, organic (Corg.) and total nitrogen (Ntot). Within the scope of this study signifi cant differences were found in pH H2O, texture and concentration of nitrogen in O horizon, as well as in the organic and mineral soil layers in forest stands with different dominant species. There is a correlation between dominant specie, site index, and content of clay particles in soil. Spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) grows better in loamy soils (clay content 7...10%). Horizon O of forest soils is moderately to strongly acidic. The most acidic conditions were found in pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. Content of total nitrogen in Horizon O depends on species composition of the stand as well as on the origin of soil material (organic or mineral). The highest content of total nitrogen was found in spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) and pine stands in Horizon O, which overlays organic soil. In Latvia the content of organic carbon in soil (0...80 cm deep) and Horizon O in forest soils is 754 +- 185 mill. t. This means that organic carbon stock in soil is considerably higher than in living biomass and therefore soil is a highly important element of natural carbon sequestration and as such it should be monitored and protected at least with the same care as the living forest biomass.ags:ARN="CZ2014000101" , 89478  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/89478_en.html , This paper analyses the French sugar industry and demonstrates its impact on the French economy. The development of the sugar industry began in the 18th century thanks to imports of sugarcane from overseas colonies. The production of sugar beet was initiated by Napoleon Bonaparte in the beginning of the 19th century. The industrial revolution contributed to the rationalization of production and helped France become the European leader. In the 1960s, France contributed to the Common Agricultural Policy project. The year 1968, when the CMO was founded, was important for the whole sugar industry. One of the reasons for growing market concentration became the principle of quota management. In 2006, a major reform of the EU sugar policy was implemented and this reform strengthened France's leading position on the sugar market. Nowadays, France is the world's 7th largest sugar producer and is number one in sugar beet production. For France, sugar is an important export article; the share of export on total production represents 45 %. The French sugar market is concentrated and dominated by three international groups. French specific is cooperative ownership and internationalization of sugar companies.ags:ARN="AV2012081837" , 87458  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/87458_en.html , New Connections is a directory of Irish participation in EU funded marine research projects over the period 2007-2010.

Therefore, solar energy is a real alternative, as it supplies virtually unlimited energy. Solar desalination could be an ideal solution for isolated areas which receive high solar irradiation per day. Solar Membrane Distillation (MD) is a developing technology particularly interesting for small supplies, isolated populations and autonomous systems. As it is a low temperature operation process, MD is very suitable for integration with thermal solar systems and/or waste heat recovery units; in contrast to other desalination technologies, only a coarse filtration of the water is required as pretreatment. However, the commercial availability is currently quite limited. This paper presents the promising 5-year experience and data analysis of a solar compact MD demonstration plant installed in the facilities of the Instituto Tecnol?gico de Canarias (ITC) in Playa de Pozo Izquierdo (Gran Canary Island-Spain).

Such an integrated management promotes sustainable development based on achieving a balance of environmental, social and economic objectives. Here we introduce a first draft of a generic framework which is developed in the EU FP7 project MESMA that gives guidance on how to assess the effectiveness of an existing management within a spatially defined area. More precisely, we define spatially managed areas as geographical entities where a marine planning framework is or will be used to manage multiple human activities in space and time while aiming to maintain ecosystem integrity. The framework consists of seven steps and comprises practical guidance on the selection of operational objectives and related criteria (step 1), the collation and integration of information (steps 2, 3 and 4), performance assessment (step 5), and feedback processes (steps 6 and 7). In the course of the MESMA project, this generic framework will be applied and tested in nine case studies, representing all European seas.

Using a previously modelled and validated historical extreme surge event, in November 1977, we now investigate the changes in peak surge as a result of possible future climate conditions. In order to simulate the surge, we have set up a one-way nested approach, using the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System 3D baroclinic model, from a domain covering the whole NW European continental shelf, through to a 1.85 km Irish Sea model; both areas are forced by tides, atmospheric pressure and winds.

In the EU FP7 project BioBio, we studied the effect of organic farming on species numbers at farm level on 169 randomly selected organic and non-organic farms with mostly low to medium intensity in ten European regions. Using a preferential sampling scheme based on habitat mapping, numbers of plants, earthworms, spiders and bees were assessed at farm level. A global analysis across the ten regions shows that organic farms have significantly higher numbers of plant and bee species than non-organic farms. The effect of organic farming on earthworm and spider species numbers are also positive but insignificant. The effects in absolute terms are small and much smaller than the variation between individual farms. Currently ongoing analyses aim at identifying the important driving factors for farmland biodiversity.ags:ARN="AV2012093981" , 85421  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/85421_en.html , Fostered by and embedded in the general development of information and communications technology (ICT), the evolution of tsunami warning systems (TWS) shows a significant development from seismic-centred to multi-sensor system architectures using additional sensors (e.g. tide gauges and buoys) for the detection of tsunami waves in the ocean. <br><br> Currently, the beginning implementation of regional tsunami warning infrastructures indicates a new phase in the development of TWS.

In this paper, we present results of the investigations conducted at the Trecate field site (NW Italy), which was affected in 1994 by crude oil contamination. The less invasive investigations include ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys, together with direct push sampling and soil electrical conductivity (EC) logs. Many of the geophysical measurements were conducted in time-lapse mode in order to separate static and dynamic signals, the latter being linked to strong seasonal changes in water table elevations. The main challenge was to extract significant geophysical signals linked to contamination from the mix of geological and hydrological signals present at the site.

Earth Observation (EO) data offers a potential solution to long-term biodiversity monitoring through direct mapping of habitats or by integrating Land Cover/Use (LC/LU) maps with contextual spatial information and in situ data. Therefore, it appears necessary to develop an automatic/semi-automatic translation framework of LC/LU classes to habitat classes, but also challenging due to discrepancies in domain definitions. In the context of the FP7 BIO_SOS ( www.biosos.eu ) project, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of the Food and Agricultural Organization Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy to habitat class translation. They also developed a framework to automatically translate LCCS classes into the recently proposed General Habitat Categories classification system, able to provide an exhaustive typology of habitat types, ranging from natural ecosystems to urban areas around the globe. However discrepancies in terminology, plant height criteria and basic principles between the two mapping domains inducing a number of one-to-many and many-to-many relations were identified, revealing the need of additional ecological expert knowledge to resolve the ambiguities. This paper illustrates how class phenology, class topological arrangement in the landscape, class spectral signature from multi-temporal Very High spatial Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and plant height measurements can be used to resolve such ambiguities. Concerning plant height, this paper also compares the mapping results obtained by using accurate values extracted from LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data and by exploiting EO data texture features (i.e. entropy) as a proxy of plant height information, when LIDAR data are not available.

Earth Observation (EO) data offers a potential solution to long-term biodiversity monitoring through direct mapping of habitats or by integrating Land Cover/Use (LC/LU) maps with contextual spatial information and in situ data. Therefore, it appears necessary to develop an automatic/semi-automatic translation framework of LC/LU classes to habitat classes, but also challenging due to discrepancies in domain definitions. In the context of the FP7 BIO_SOS ( www.biosos.eu ) project, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of the Food and Agricultural Organization Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy to habitat class translation. They also developed a framework to automatically translate LCCS classes into the recently proposed General Habitat Categories classification system, able to provide an exhaustive typology of habitat types, ranging from natural ecosystems to urban areas around the globe. However discrepancies in terminology, plant height criteria and basic principles between the two mapping domains inducing a number of one-to-many and many-to-many relations were identified, revealing the need of additional ecological expert knowledge to resolve the ambiguities. This paper illustrates how class phenology, class topological arrangement in the landscape, class spectral signature from multi-temporal Very High spatial Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and plant height measurements can be used to resolve such ambiguities.

Food safety experts from various stakeholder types in the farm-to-fork chain were represented: farmer related organizations (n=6), fresh produce processing and trading companies (n=17), retail (n=3), consumer organizations (n=2), competent authorities (n=7) and lastly research institutes and universities (n=19). The experts who originated mainly from European countries (92.6%) were grouped in nine discussion groups per type of stakeholder and asked to rank food safety issues via a scoring approach according to perceived importance from their stakeholder type point of view. Also information sources for opinion making, appropriate food safety control measures and perceived contextual factors increasingly challenging governance of food safety in fresh produce were ranked according to perceived importance. Although some differences were noted between opinions of the different stakeholders, there was in general an agreement on the main priorities in food safety of fresh produce. Bacterial pathogens were overall considered to be the most important food safety issue for fresh produce, followed by foodborne viruses, pesticide residues and mycotoxins. Alert systems such as the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) were considered as the most important source of information of food safety issues, followed by reports of international organizations (e.g. WHO, EFSA), legislative documents (e.g. EU legislation), national reports (e.g. on monitoring hazards, foodborne outbreaks) and exchange of information between people (informal contacts). Concerning the control measures, the application of good agricultural practices (GAP) was identified to be the most important control measure to assure the safety of fresh produce, followed by the application of good hygienic practices (GHP) and the certification of food safety management systems (FSMS). Increasing international trade and globalization were overall expected to have a large impact on food safety in fresh produce. Other contextual factors perceived to be important were the food safety policies by governments and the (lack of) food safety knowledge by consumers and other stakeholders of the fresh produce supply chain. Although the various stakeholder groups may conceive issues differently from their proper position in the fresh produce supply chain, no deep disagreements emerged. This type of workshop enhances interaction and risk communication between stakeholders and contributes to a better understanding of each other's concerns, constraints and interests to deal with the food safety of the increasingly complex and globalized fresh produce supply chain.ags:ARN="US201400187085" , 96974  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96974_en.html , PURPOSE: As capture fishery production has reached its limits and global demand for aquatic products is still increasing, aquaculture has become the worlds fastest growing animal production sector. In attempts to evaluate the environmental consequences of this rapid expansion, life cycle assessment (LCA) has become a frequently used method. The present review of current peer-reviewed literature focusing on LCA of aquaculture systems is intended to clarify the methodological choices made, identify possible data gaps, and provide recommendations for future development within this field of research. The results of this review will also serve as a start-up activity of the EU FP7 SEAT (Sustaining Ethical Aquaculture Trade) project, which aims to perform several LCA studies on aquaculture systems in Asia over the next few years. METHODS: From a full analysis of methodology in LCA, six phases were identified to differ the most amongst ten peer-reviewed articles and two PhD theses (functional unit, system boundaries, data and data quality, allocation, impact assessment methods, interpretation methods). Each phase is discussed with regards to differences amongst the studies, current LCA literature followed by recommendations where appropriate. The conclusions and recommendations section reflects on aquaculture-specific scenarios as well as on some more general issues in LCA. RESULTS: Aquaculture LCAs often require large system boundaries, including fisheries, agriculture, and livestock production systems from around the globe. The reviewed studies offered limited coverage of production in developing countries, low-intensity farming practices, and non-finfish species, although most farmed aquatic products originate from a wide range of farming practices in Asia. Apart from different choices of functional unit, system boundaries and impact assessment methods, the studies also differed in their choice of allocation factors and data sourcing. Interpretation of results also differed amongst the studies, and a number of methodological choices were identified influencing the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Efforts should be made to increase transparency to allow the results to be reproduced, and to construct aquaculture related database(s). More extensive data reporting, including environmental flows, within the greater field of LCA could be achieved, without compromising the focus of studies, by providing supporting information to articles and/or reporting only ID numbers from background databases.

For this purpose a multicriteria model was formulated, at farm household level, in order to study the social impacts of the CAPs using different scenarios. The scenarios were chosen on the basis of the main EU policies affecting farm households, such as the alternative crops scenario, the Water Framework Directive scenario and the agrienvironmental schemes scenario. The data for this analysis resulted from the CAP-IRE project, a European FP7-funded project. The model includes a utility function with several conflicting criteria such as maximization of gross margin and risk and labour minimization. The model is further used to simulate the impacts on social sustainability by estimating main social indicators. The model is applied in two different farm types in Greece. The results show that the CAP scenarios have multiple social impacts on agricultural holdings, and particularly on the farm labour structure. These impacts have negative effect on social sustainability.ags:ARN="US201500003890" , 88424  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/88424_en.html , This paper aims to assess the impacts of household behaviour on social sustainability by simulating agricultural policy scenarios of the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

In the EU's 6th FP BRIDGE project Background cRiteria for the IDentification of Groundwater thrEsholds, a methodology for the derivation of threshold values (TV) for groundwater bodies is proposed. This methodology is tested on four aquifers in Flanders of the sand and gravel typology. The methodology works well for all but the Ledo-Paniselian aquifer, where the subdivision into a fresh and saline part is disproved, as a gradual natural transition from fresh to saline conditions in the aquifer is observed. The 90 percentile is proposed as natural background level (NBL) for the unconfined Pleistocene deposits, ascribing the outliers to possible influence of pollution. For the Tertiary aquifers, high values for different parameters have a natural origin and the 97.7 percentile is preferred as NBL. The methodology leads to high TVs for parameters presenting low NBL, when compared to the standard used as a reference.

Application of spatial data of different scales coupled with socio-economic data makes it possible to explore and test the understanding of land use change relations. In the EU-FP7 research project PASHMINA (Paradigm Shift modelling and innovative approaches), three storylines of future transportation paradigm shifts towards 2040 are created. These storylines are translated into spatial planning strategies and modelled using the cellular automata model LUCIA. For the modelling, an Eastern Danish case area was selected, comprising of the Copenhagen metropolitan area and its hinterland. The different scenarios are described using a range of different descriptive GIS datasets. These include mapping of accessibility based on public and private transportation, urban density and structure, and distribution of jobs and population. These indicators are then incorporated in the model calculations as factors determining urban development, related to the scenario outlines. The results calculated from the scenarios reveals the great difference in urban distribution that different spatial planning strategies can produce, changing the shape of the urban landscape. The scenarios visualized showed to outline different planning strategies that could be implemented, creating a more homogenous urban structure targeted at a reduction of transportation work and thus energy consumption. This will lead to less impact on climate from transportation based on a more optimal localization and transport infrastructure strategy.ags:ARN="US201500202696" , 105734  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/105734_en.html , The modelling of land use change is a way to analyse future scenarios by modelling different pathways.

This article seeks to assess two recently implemented EU directives on environmental issues in light of this aim, namely the directives on Air Quality Management and Strategic Environmental Assessment. Drawing on theoretical foundations and empirical evidence from the EU FP6 project Governance for Sustainability, this article seeks to understand how policy integration is a matter of knowledge use, which is again related to the governance arrangements in which implementation takes place. Drawing on a total of 15 case studies in nine countries, the article finds that actual decision-making practice varies a lot albeit based on the same directives. In many cases, the directives were viewed as a sectoral environmental tools, and these cases were often dominated by expert knowledge being funnelled through relatively closed, hierarchical governance arrangements. In other cases, however, the directives were viewed as opportunities for politicians to cultivate a network mode of governance that aspired to arguing and sometimes opened up for competing knowledge claims.ags:ARN="US201400160326" , 96974  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96974_en.html , PURPOSE: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 99? % of companies operating in the European food and drink industry and, often, are part of highly fragmented and complex food chains.

METHODS: The article reviews both academic and grey literature on life cycle assessment (LCA) and its relationship to social LCA (S-LCA) and SMEs at the beginning of 2013 and includes case study evidence from the food sector. A pilot questionnaire survey sent to European food and drink sector SMEs and trade associations (as partners in the research project) about their knowledge, experience and engagement with social impacts is presented. Proposals are elaborated for a social impact assessment methodology that identifies the key data for SMEs to collect. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature reveals the complexity of the S-LCA approach as it aims to unite disparate and often conflicting interests. Findings from the pilot questionnaire are discussed. Using a top-down and bottom-up approach, the proposed methodology assesses data from SMEs along the supply chain in order to gauge social improvements in the management of labour-related issues for different product sectors. Issues relating to the attributional choice of a social impact indicator and key stakeholder categories are discussed. How scoring is interpreted and reported and what the intended effect of its use will be are also elaborated upon.

This decision tool formed the basis of a recent EU research project, BENEFISH which was funded via the European Commission's Sixth Framework (FP6) initiative. The bio-economic decision model can incorporate biological data, productivity data, micro (farm) and macro (industry) level economic data, and consumer marketing and business to business data. It can identify areas for potential added value that might be achieved by improving fish welfare across a range of species and husbandry systems within European aquaculture. This article provides a brief overview of the minimum data requirements for successfully modeling the bio-economic impacts of improvements in farmed fish welfare using the model developed during the BENEFISH project. It also highlights potential bottlenecks and the minimum prerequisites for each potential data set to be used for successful modeling.ags:ARN="US201301604661" , 87955  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/87955_en.html , PRATIQUE is an EC-funded 7th Framework research project designed to address the major challenges for pest risk analysis (PRA) in Europe.

As a result the national, annual chestnut production was reduced from 18,000 tons in the 1960s to 11,000 tons in 2005. A project for the application of biological control on a nationwide scale was funded and implemented during the period 2007-2009. Hypovirulent (hv) strains of Cryphonectria parasitica have been introduced by artificial inoculation into the 17 most important and most heavily infected chestnut growing prefectures. Four vc types were identified in the entire country, those of EU-1, EU-2, EU-10 with the dominant being EU-12 counting for 88%. Hypovirulent inoculum in the form of paste using the spontaneously appearing CHV-1 subtype 1 (Italian subtype) virus was prepared at the Forest Research Institute. It was specific for each prefecture and compatible with the local vc types of the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica according to a vc type distribution map that had been previously elaborated. Three million inoculations in total were made around developing cankers in three consecutive years by trained personnel. An evaluation conducted in 2011 showed that the hypovirulent strains which were introduced had established in all treated areas. Most importantly, the hypovirulent strains had started spreading from the inoculated cankers to non-inoculated ones. The extent of dissemination varied significantly among sampling plots within and among treated prefectures according to the management type (orchards, coppice or high forest), age of trees and horticultural or silvicultural practices applied.

A comparison of the test guidelines for drugs, agrochemicals and industrial chemicals shows that, for historical reasons, significantly different testing strategies are applied. The current status of development and validation of in vitro tests in reproductive toxicology is also critically evaluated. The mouse embryonic stem cell test (mEST) is the most advanced and promising of the in vitro tests. Although it has not yet been accepted for regulatory purposes, its use in preclinical drug development is well established. Moreover, promising molecular endpoints have been established in the mEST, including proteomic and toxicogenomic endpoints. Preliminary results have been obtained with a human EST (hEST). In addition, an overview is given on new in vitro reproductive toxicity tests that are currently being developed in the EU FP6 project, ReProTect, since the ReProTect test battery, which covers the essential steps of female and male fertility, implantation and embryotoxicity, holds promise for use as a screening assay for reproductive toxicity testing according to the EU REACH legislation. However, since validated in vitro methods will not be available in the short term, opportunities for the refinement of the standard in vivo tests are discussed, in order to reduce the numbers of animal used in reproductive toxicity testing. Finally, recommendations for toxicity testing in the 21st century call for the harmonisation of test methods across all areas of regulatory testing as a first step. Since the REACH system testing framework for industrial chemicals is driven by the reproductive safety testing requirements of agrochemicals, a shift is proposed to exposure-driven testing of industrial chemicals. In particular, the implementation of a new extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study (EOGRTS), which includes triggers for additional testing for fertility, developmental neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity, would significantly reduce test animal numbers. It is concluded that in vitro methods hold great promise for reproductive toxicity testing in the 21st century, e.g. the ReProTect in vitro battery and the embryonic stem cell (ESC) technology focusing on molecular endpoints in both the mEST and the hEST.ags:ARN="US201301812403" , 97667  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/97667_en.html , The use of experimental animals in reproductive toxicity testing is critically reviewed on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the publication of the Three Rs concept by Russell and Burch, since there is major concern that reproductive toxicity testing will significantly increase due to the requirements of the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) system.

A comparison of the test guidelines for drugs, agrochemicals and industrial chemicals shows that, for historical reasons, significantly different testing strategies are applied. The current status of development and validation of in vitro tests in reproductive toxicology is also critically evaluated. The mouse embryonic stem cell test (mEST) is the most advanced and promising of the in vitro tests. Although it has not yet been accepted for regulatory purposes, its use in preclinical drug development is well established. Moreover, promising molecular endpoints have been established in the mEST, including proteomic and toxicogenomic endpoints. Preliminary results have been obtained with a human EST (hEST). In addition, an overview is given on new in vitro reproductive toxicity tests that are currently being developed in the EU FP6 project, ReProTect, since the ReProTect test battery, which covers the essential steps of female and male fertility, implantation and embryotoxicity, holds promise for use as a screening assay for reproductive toxicity testing according to the EU REACH legislation. However, since validated in vitro methods will not be available in the short term, opportunities for the refinement of the standard in vivo tests are discussed, in order to reduce the numbers of animal used in reproductive toxicity testing. Finally, recommendations for toxicity testing in the 21st century call for the harmonisation of test methods across all areas of regulatory testing as a first step. Since the REACH system testing framework for industrial chemicals is driven by the reproductive safety testing requirements of agrochemicals, a shift is proposed to exposure-driven testing of industrial chemicals. In particular, the implementation of a new extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study (EOGRTS), which includes triggers for additional testing for fertility, developmental neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity, would significantly reduce test animal numbers. It is concluded that in vitro methods hold great promise for reproductive toxicity testing in the 21st century, e.g. the ReProTect in vitro battery and the embryonic stem cell (ESC) technology focusing on molecular endpoints in both the mEST and the hEST.ags:ARN="RS201301277" , 96974  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96974_en.html , We assess the changes in drought conditions during summer in the Republic of Moldova based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated from monthly precipitation data simulated by the regional climatic model RegCM3. The RegCM simulations were conducted at a horizontal resolution of 10 km in the framework of EU-FP6 project -CECILIA. The domain was centered over Romania at 46N, 25E and included the Republic of Moldova. First, we validate the model ability to simulate monthly temperature and precipitation. We compare the model simulations forced by ERA40 with the observations from CRU TS2.0 dataset and station observations. The changes in annual cycle of temperature and precipitation is analyzed by comparing the model simulations conducted under A1B scenario for the periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 with the control run for the period 1961-1990. The SPI (1 to 24-month) calculated for each grid point of Moldova domain in the RegCM simulation were spatially averaged and compared with the corresponding SPI calculated from CRU data. The results show the intensification of summer drought severity due to reduced precipitation in the context of general warming in Moldova. The persistence of medium and long time-scale drought is projected to rise as well as the frequency of severe droughts.ags:ARN="RS201301277" , 92164  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/92164_en.html , We assess the changes in drought conditions during summer in the Republic of Moldova based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated from monthly precipitation data simulated by the regional climatic model RegCM3.

Bread baking is one of the most energy demanding processes (around 4MJ/kg), compared with other thermal processes such as canning. However, there is a large variability of data in the literature. For partial baking, bread has to be baked twice. It may also be frozen after part baking, which will increase the total energy demand. Results obtained with equipment used by craft bakeries are presented. Conventional and frozen part baked processes are compared. The effect of occupation ratio on the overall energy demand is also assessed. It was observed that 15-20% of the total energy is used for heating up the dough and 10-20% for crust drying. Pre-heating of the oven represents another significant energy demand. The energy demand for freezing is comparable to that for baking. An Energy Efficiency Index is used to assess the ratio of energy effectively transferred to the dough during baking. Part baked frozen technology demands about 2.2 times as much energy as conventional bread making process.ags:ARN="US201500009025" , 98504  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/98504_en.html , Human adenoviruses (HAdV) may be implicated in some disease outbreaks associated with recreational water exposures, typically in swimming pools. Modern molecular methods can be used to detect HAdV in environmental water samples. During the EU FP6 Project VIROBATHE a database of over 290 HAdV analyses with corresponding faecal indicator organism (FIO) determinations was gathered and used to explore statistical associations between HAdV and FIO results. The FIOs measured were Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and somatic coliphage. Statistically significant trends of increasing proportions of HAdV-positive results in categories of increasing FIO concentration were found in freshwater but not seawater samples. The analysis of these trends in freshwater samples was refined, the trends remaining statistically significant when using categories of 0.5log?? intervals of FIO concentration. Logistic regression models were then developed to predict the probability of a HAdV-positive outcome from FIO concentration. Potential applications of these models to predict the probability of HAdV-positive outcomes from routine FIO determinations used to describe recreational water quality exposures and to classify recreational water quality are discussed.ags:ARN="US201500009025" , 94954  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/94954_en.html , Human adenoviruses (HAdV) may be implicated in some disease outbreaks associated with recreational water exposures, typically in swimming pools.

Furthermore, it identified cost-efficient and value-adding use of biomass for energy and industry. The aims of this article are to provide a synthesis of the key results of this project. Estimated annual solid biomass potential in the EU-27 is almost 6600PJ (157Mtoe), of which 48% is currently utilised. The greatest potential for increased use lies in forest residues and herbaceous biomass. Trade barriers have been evaluated and some solutions suggested such as CN codes for wood pellets and price indexes for industrial wood pellets and wood chips. The analysis of wood pellet and wood chip prices revealed large difference amongst EU countries, but also that on the short term prices of woody and fossil fuels are barely correlated. Sustainable production and use of solid biomass are also deemed important by most European stakeholders, and many support the introduction of harmonised sustainability criteria, albeit under a number of preconditions. The study identified also that a number of woody and agro-industrial residue streams remain un- or underutilised. The estimated European total potential of agro-industrial sources is more than 250PJ (7.2Mtoe), the amount of unutilised woody biomass (the annual increment of growing stock) even amounts to 3150PJ (75Mtoe). Finally 35 case studies of biomass heating substituting fossil fuels were carried out, showing that the potential to reduce GHG emissions ranges between 90 and 98%, while costs are very similar to fossil fuel heating systems. Overall, we conclude that solid biomass is growing strongly, and is likely to heavily contribute to the EU renewable energy targets in the coming decade.ags:ARN="US201500126124" , 108791  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/108791_en.html , The EUBIONET III project has boosted (i) sustainable, transparent international biomass fuel trade, (ii) investments in best practice technologies and (iii) new services on biomass heat sector.

The EFI+ software and manual have been developed within the EFI+ project. The EFI+ project was funded by the European Commission (EC) under the 6th Framework Programme, Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development, Key Action 1: Sustainable Management and Quality of Water of the European Commission (Specific Targeted Research Project FP6-2005-SSP-5-A, Task 4: Ecological status assessment  filling the gaps).In the year 2000, the EC adopted a new legislation, the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This new legislation, now implemented in 27 EU member countries, aims for good ecological conditions in all surface waters. Fishes are, for the first time, part of a European-wide monitoring network designed to assess the ecological status of running waters. Between 2001 and 2004 the EC funded the FAME project developed, evaluated and implemented new standardised fish-based methods to assess the ecological status of running waters in Europe (FP5, Energy, Environment and Sustainable Management. Key Action 1: Sustainable Management and Quality of Water, EVK1-CT-2001-00094, http://fame.boku.ac.at).The main output of the FAME project was the European Fish Index (EFI), the first standardised fish-based assessment method applicable across a wide range of European rivers. The EFI employs a number of environmental descriptors to predict biological reference conditions and then quantifies the deviation of the fish community structure from these reference conditions on a statistical basis. The EFI was developed mainly based on data from Western and Northern Europe and was calibrated against estimates of human pressures and impacts. Although a wide range of river types was included in the development of the EFI, some river types, e.g. very large rivers, were underrepresented.The EFI has now been tested by European countries within their national monitoring programmes and has been evaluated for use for reporting under the WFD. During this evaluation process a number of limitations were observed in the performance of the index. Therefore, the overall objective of the EFI+ project was to overcome the existing limitations of the EFI by developing a new, more accurate and pan-European fish index. The scientific and technological objectives were to (1) evaluate the applicability of the existing EFI and make necessary improvements in Central-Eastern Europe and Mediterranean ecoregions; (2) extend the scope of the existing EFI to cover large rivers; (3) analyse relationships between hydromorphological pressures (including continuity disruption) and fish assemblages to increase the accuracy of the EFI; (4) adapt the existing software to the requirements of the EFI+ to allow calculation of the ecological status for running waters.This manual is divided in two parts.Part I introduces the concepts and methods on which the EFI+ is based.

The acceptance of the new terminology was studied focus group interviews. Three focus groups were organised with consumers (elderly age consumers, young adults and health conscious consumers) and one more focus group with experts of food sciences, specialised in technology, legislation, food policy, consumer sciences and nutrition sciences. The results of the focus group interviews with consumers highlighted, that name 'micro pulse' evokes better associations than the pulsed electric field and 'micro pulse' is in no way associated with 'electricity'. Consumers expressed their definite need of getting informed about the new technologies even if this leads to distrust because of the lack of comprehensive knowledge. Consumers judgment about the change of the technical term is diverse: according to the opinion of two focus groups, it is not misleading to use the name 'micro pulse' instead of PEF, though the electrical feature of the treatment should be mentioned. According to the respondents of the health conscious focus group, change of the name is misleading, because the aim is the reduction of consumers' fears. The most important issues rose by the expert focus group, namely that clear communication is essential for the consumers, and the electrical feature of the technology has to be expressed. The term ?pulsed electric field is threatening and ?micro pulse is not informative. The term ?micro electrical pulse might be acceptable according to the experts.

Here, this link and its temporal evolution over France during the twentieth century is further investigated and related to the atmospheric circulation and North Atlantic/Mediterranean sea surface temperature (SST) patterns. Observational datasets of precipitation, mean sea level pressure (MSLP), atmospheric teleconnection patterns, and SST, as well as various global and regional climate model simulations are analyzed. The investigation of observed precipitation by means of a running correlation with a 30-year time window for the period 1901-present reveals a decreasing trend in the spring-to-autumn correlations, which become significantly negative in the second half of the twentieth century. These negative correlations are connected with similar spring-to-autumn correlations in observed MSLP, and with negatively correlated spring East Atlantic (EA) and autumn Scandinavian (SCA) teleconnection pattern indices. Maximum covariance analyses of SST with these atmospheric variables indicate that at least part of the identified spring-to-autumn link is mediated through SST, as spring precipitation and MSLP are connected with the same autumn SST pattern as are autumn precipitation, MSLP and the SCA pattern index. Except for ERA-40 driven regional climate models from the EU-FP6 project ENSEMBLES, the analyzed regional and global climate models, including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) simulations, do not capture this observed variability in precipitation.

The investigation of observed precipitation by means of a running correlation with a 30-year time window for the period 1901-present reveals a decreasing trend in the spring-to-autumn correlations, which become significantly negative in the second half of the twentieth century. These negative correlations are connected with similar spring-to-autumn correlations in observed MSLP, and with negatively correlated spring East Atlantic (EA) and autumn Scandinavian (SCA) teleconnection pattern indices. Maximum covariance analyses of SST with these atmospheric variables indicate that at least part of the identified spring-to-autumn link is mediated through SST, as spring precipitation and MSLP are connected with the same autumn SST pattern as are autumn precipitation, MSLP and the SCA pattern index. Except for ERA-40 driven regional climate models from the EU-FP6 project ENSEMBLES, the analyzed regional and global climate models, including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) simulations, do not capture this observed variability in precipitation. This is associated with the failure of most models in simulating the observed correlations between spring and autumn MSLP. While the causes for the identified relationship cannot be fully established its timing suggests a possible link with increased aerosol loading in the global dimming period.ags:ARN="US201500183423" , 104265  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/104265_en.html , Central Asia features an extreme continental climate with mostly arid to semi-arid conditions. Due to low precipitation and therefore low water availability, water is a scarce resource and often the limiting factor for socio-economic development. The aim of this model study was to compare the uncertainties of hydrological modelling induced by global and regional climate data sets and to calculate the impacts on estimates of renewable water resources. Within this integrated model study the hydrological and water use model Water Global Assessment and Prognosis 3 (WaterGAP 3) is being applied to all river basins located in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia in five arc minutes spatial resolution (~6?9km/grid cell). The model was driven by different global and regional climate data sets to estimate their impact on modelled water resources in Central Asia. In detail, these are the global TS data set of the Climate Research Unit (CRU), the WATCH forcing data (WFD) developed within the EUFP6 Project WATer and global Change, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) Reanalysis product v6, and the regional Aphrodites Water Resources data set (Aphrodite). The performance of the model is then being evaluated by comparing modelled and observed river discharge for the time period 19712000. Finally, the uncertainties in modelled water availability induced by the different data sets are quantified to point out the consequences for water management. Over the entire region, mean and maximum annual precipitations given by the various data sets differ by 13% and up to 42%, respectively. In addition, considerable deviation of temporal dynamics is found in some locations, where a pairwise comparison showed poor agreement between CRU and GPCC/WFD (NashSutcliffe efficiency 0.27/0.23). Thus, also modelled discharge shows high temporal and spatial variations which leads to differences in median model efficiency of 0.11 between the data sets.ags:ARN="US201500183423" , 188832  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/188832_en.html , Central Asia features an extreme continental climate with mostly arid to semi-arid conditions.

Yield prediction is a relevant pre-requisite for the EU and US commissions, shipper, retailer, fruit trade, marketing organisations and fruit grower. The objective of this joint project was to develop an alternative to the present yield prediction method based on manual visual fruit counting. The new scheme utilizes digital images with a resolution of at least 1280 ? 980 pixel. Digital images were taken in July of fully-grown apple trees on M.9 at Klein-Altendorf near Bonn, Germany and other sites in Europe with different crop loads. Image analysis was employed to predict yield on a net acreage, defined as 93% of gross orchard acreage for the purpose of this study. Harvest data were compared with yield prediction and presented as harvest prediction index, i.e. the ratio of predicted to harvested fruit yield. This harvest prediction index ranged between 0.7 and 1.2 over 3 years for three major apple cultivars Golden Delicious, Braeburn and Elstar. The image analysis software was optimised over the three years for the majority of fruit orchards with best results in the 25-50 t/ha yield range. The upper limit for the current image analysis software is 200 fruit/tree. Larger yields than 50 t/ha are under-estimated, because larger fruit loads on the tree resulted in overlapping fruit segments in the images with under-estimation of fruit number and yield; similarly, yields lower than 25 t/ha are over-estimated. Yield prediction was more accurate for early ripening than late-ripening apple cultivars due to the longer period between yield prediction and harvest and weather in between. Higher image resolution than 1.5 megapixel (Mpx) did not improve the accuracy of the yield prediction, but required more than 1 min for the fully automated image analysis of a single image. The accuracy of the yield prediction can be further improved by a larger number of photos per tree and fine tuning of the customised software, but not by higher resolution of the digital images vs. photos, which only slowed the process down. The vision or possible future of this informal initiative is a low-cost, still slow but efficient, fully (or largely) automated scheme, in which any fruit farmer in the world with an ordinary digital camera could participate at low cost with reasonable orchard records, if he follows simple instructions for the photography. The digital images could be posted or mailed via an FTP server for image analysis.ags:ARN="US201500070870" , 91089  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/91089_en.html , A field experiment was carried out in Northern Italy, within the frame of the EU project SAFIR, to test the feasibility of partial root-zone drying (PRD) irrigation management in potatoes and to compare the PRD irrigation strategy with regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). PRD increased total and first class tuber yield by 4.7% compared to RDI. Tuber weight was significantly (P<0.05) higher in the average as compared with RDI (+14.9 g). In dry years, PRD produced significantly more starch and less reducing sugars than RDI, but this did not occur in the rainy year.

WARBO is aimed at implementing large-scale use of artificial recharge in Italy where water directives still strongly limit its application. In this context, the Mereto recharge site was selected in the upper Fruili plain where the water availability is guaranteed during winter period by the Tagliamento and Ledra Rivers. An infiltration basin, about 5.5m deep and 45?7mwide, was built at Mereto in the early 2000s but the possibility of implementing the recharge has been allowed only very recently. The site is characterized by an elevation of 105m asl and the depth to the groundwater table averages 50m. Below a few meter-thick organic soil, the aquifer is composed by coarse deposits with an estimated thickness of 100m and an average vertical hydraulic conductivity on the order of 10??m/s. A ~0.1m/s infiltration flow has been preliminary estimated (corresponding to an infiltration rate of 60cm/h). Geophysical investigations (electrical resistivity tomography, high-resolution seismic surveys) together with infiltration and pumping tests have been carried out to characterize the vadose zone and the unconfined aquifer in the study area. Functional approaches and three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element numerical computations have been used to predict the effect of the artificial recharge. The results of these investigations will greatly reduce the hydrogeological knowledge gaps and will be used to fine tune the recharge program and to define the monitoring concept. This contribution aims to provide a methodology for the implementation of managed aquifer recharge programs using existing structures.ags:ARN="US201500183688" , 111209  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/111209_en.html , To cope with the general reduction of water availability and increase the subsurface storage of high-quality surficial waters, an artificial recharge project is ongoing in northern Italy within the WARBO LIFE+ Project funded by EU.

Among the unknowns are the effects of an increasing frequency of acute, short-lasting winter warming events. Such events can damage higher plants exposed to warm, then returning cold, temperatures after snow melt and it is not known how bryophytes and lichens, which are of considerable ecological importance in high-latitude ecosystems, are affected by such warming events. However, even physiological adaptations of these cryptogams to winter environments in general are poorly understood.Here we describe findings from a novel field experiment that uses heating from infrared lamps and soil warming cables to simulate acute mid-winter warming events in a sub-Arctic heath. In particular, we report the growing season responses of the dominant lichen, Peltigera aphthosa, and bryophyte, Hylocomium splendens, to warming events in three consecutive winters.While summertime photosynthetic performance of P. aphthosa was unaffected by the winter warming treatments, H. splendens showed significant reductions of net photosynthetic rates and growth rates (of up to 48% and 52% respectively). Negative effects were evident already during the summer following the first winter warming event.While the lichen develops without going through critical phenological stages during which vulnerable organs are produced, the moss has a seasonal rhythm, which includes initiation of growth of young, freeze-susceptible shoot apices in the early growing season; these might be damaged by breaking of dormancy during warm winter events.Synthesis. Different sensitivities of the bryophyte and lichen species were unexpected, and illustrate that very little is known about the winter ecology of bryophytes and lichens from cold biomes in general. In sharp contrast to summer warming experiments that show increased vascular plant biomass and reduced lichen biomass, these results demonstrate that acute climate events in mid-winter may be readily tolerated by lichens, in contrast to previously observed sensitivity of co-occurring dwarf shrubs, suggesting winter climate change may compensate for (or even reverse) predicted lichen declines resulting from summer warming.ags:ARN="AV2012074011" , 103895  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/103895_en.html , Climate change in northern high latitudes is predicted to be greater in winter rather than summer, yet little is known about the effects of winter climate change on northern ecosystems.

In order to better understand the response of continental ecosystems to paleoclimate changes in southern South America, we investigated the sedimentary record of Puyehue Lake, located in the western piedmont of the Andes in south-central Chile (40S). We analyzed the elemental (C, N) and stable isotopic (13C, 15N) composition of the sedimentary organic matter preserved in the lake and its watershed to estimate the relative changes in the sources of sedimentary organic carbon through space and time. The geochemical signature of the aquatic and terrestrial end-members was determined on samples of lake particulate organic matter (N/C: 0.130) and Holocene paleosols (N/C: 0.069), respectively. A simple mixing equation based on the N/C ratio of these end-members was then used to estimate the fraction of terrestrial carbon (T) preserved in the lake sediments. Our approach was validated using surface sediment samples, which show a strong relation between T and distance to the main rivers and to the shore. We further applied this equation to an 11.22 m long sediment core to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes in Puyehue Lake and its watershed during the last 17.9 kyr. Our data provide evidence for a first warming pulse at 17.3 cal kyr BP, which triggered a rapid increase in lake diatom productivity, lagging the start of a similar increase in sea surface temperature (SST) off Chile by 1500 years. This delay is best explained by the presence of a large glacier in the lake watershed, which delayed the response time of the terrestrial proxies and limited the concomitant expansion of the vegetation in the lake watershed (low T). A second warming pulse at 12.8 cal kyr BP is inferred from an increase in lake productivity and a major expansion of the vegetation in the lake watershed, demonstrating that the Puyehue glacier had considerably retreated from the watershed. This second warming pulse is synchronous with a 2C increase in SST off the coast of Chile, and its timing corresponds to the beginning of the Younger Dryas Chronozone. These results contribute to the mounting evidence that the climate in the mid-latitudes of the southern Hemisphere was warming during the Younger Dryas Chronozone, in agreement with the bipolar see-saw hypothesis.ags:ARN="AV20120150400" , 95952  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/95952_en.html , Since the last deglaciation, the mid-latitudes of the southern Hemisphere have undergone considerable environmental changes.

The structure of the Caribbean plate and the subducting Atlantic plate was determined through a combined analysis of ocean bottom seismometer and multi-channel seismic data along a transect between 15N and 17N. A detailed analysis of a priori and a posteriori information of a Monte Carlo based tomography scheme with a subsequent structural evaluation by forward modeling are applied to a 2-d seismic profile south of Guadeloupe. The island arc crust of the Caribbean plate has an average thickness of 282 km and overrides the approximately 8 km thick late cretaceous (80 Ma) Atlantic crust. The island arc crust shows two distinct reflections, which are interpreted as an intracrustal and Moho discontinuity, respectively. To a depth of 40 km the Atlantic lithosphere subducts at an average angle of 40. The accretionary prism gains a thickness of more than 10 km and shows high energy attenuation in the middle prism. A backstop structure is imaged by a strong lateral increase of the vertical velocity gradient superimposed on structural heterogeneities. The decollement zone reaches a thickness of up to 1.8 km and shows no seismic phase polarity change. The slow convergence rate and the subduction of the Tiburon and Barracuda ridges make this subduction zone a prime candidate for major earthquakes. Between 15N and 17N, the seismogenic rupture area is approximated by the contact zone between the backstop and the mantle wedge. Accordingly, this area is capable of triggering an earthquake of a magnitude of Mw 7.6 and indeed makes this active European subduction zone a place of major telluric risk.ags:ARN="AV2012076147" , 100541  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100541_en.html , In the context of the EU funded THALES project active seismic investigations were conducted along the Lesser Antilles subduction zone, using both, wide-angle and near-vertical techniques.

Accordingly, this area is capable of triggering an earthquake of a magnitude of Mw 7.6 and indeed makes this active European subduction zone a place of major telluric risk.ags:ARN="US201301683382" , 90717  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/90717_en.html , The epidemiological surveys in children and adults of the EU-funded multidisciplinary Integrated Project EuroPrevall, launched in June 2005, were designed to estimate the currently unknown prevalence of food allergy and exposure to known or suspected risk factors for food allergy across Europe. We describe the protocol for the epidemiological surveys in children and adults. This protocol provides specific instructions on the sampling strategy, the use of questionnaires, and collection of blood samples for immunological analyses. The surveys were performed as multi-centre, cross-sectional studies in general populations. Case-control studies were nested within these surveys. The studies in children aged 7-10 years and adults aged 20-54 years were undertaken in eight centres representing different social and climatic regions in Europe. After a community-based survey collecting basic information on adverse reactions to foods, all those stating they had experienced such reactions, as well as of a random sample of those stating 'no reactions' to foods, completed a detailed questionnaire on potential risks and exposures. Also a blood sample was taken to allow serological analysis to establish patterns of food and aeroallergen sensitization. We also included a questionnaire to schools on their preparedness for dealing with food allergy amongst pupils. Subjects reporting adverse reactions to foods and sensitized to the same food(s) were called in for a full clinical evaluation that included a double blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), following a protocol which is described in detail elsewhere. The outcome of these studies will help to improve our understanding of several important aspects of food allergies in the European Community, providing for more well-informed policies and effective measures of disease prevention, diagnosis and management.ags:ARN="US201301683382" , 108827  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/108827_en.html , The epidemiological surveys in children and adults of the EU-funded multidisciplinary Integrated Project EuroPrevall, launched in June 2005, were designed to estimate the currently unknown prevalence of food allergy and exposure to known or suspected risk factors for food allergy across Europe.

Some members of this genus have a quarantine status, and accurate species identification is required to prevent further spreading. DNA barcoding is a method for organism identification in non-complex DNA backgrounds based on informative motifs in short DNA stretches (?600? bp). As part of the EU 7th Framework project QBOL, 15 Meloidogyne species were chosen to compare the resolutions offered by two typical DNA barcoding loci, COI and COII, with the distinguishing signals produced by two ribosomal DNA genes (small and large subunit rDNA; SSU???1,700 and LSU???3,400? bp). None of the four markers distinguished between the tropical species Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica and M. arenaria. Taking P ID (Liberal) values ?0.93 as a measure for species delimitation, the four mtDNA and rDNA markers performed well for the tropical Meloidogyne species complex, M. enterolobii, M. hapla, and M. maritima. Within cluster III A (Holterman et al. Phytopathology, 99, 227235, 2009), SSU rDNA did not offer resolution at species level. Both mtDNA loci COI and COII did, whereas for LSU rDNA a longer fragment (?700? bp) is required. The high level of mitochondrial heteroplasmy recently reported for M. chitwoodi (Humphreys-Pereira and Elling Nematology, 15, 315327, 2013) was not found in the populations under investigation, suggesting this could be a regional phenomenon. For identification of RKNs, we suggest the combined use of SSU rDNA with one of three other markers presented here.ags:ARN="US201301845565" , 88212  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/88212_en.html , Background, aim and scope The paper presents concentrations of trace elements in blood of homebred animals (cows and sheep) from Southern Serbia (Bujanovac) and the contents of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides and some heavy metals in feed. The region of Southern Serbia was exposed to contamination by depleted uranium ammunition during NATO attacks in 1999 and therefore, is of great concern to environmental pollution and human and animal health. Materials and methods Conventional instrumental and epithermal neutron activation analyses are used to measure trace elements in cow and sheep blood samples collected randomly at six locations in the region of Bujanovac (village of Borovac) in the spring of 2005. Samples of feed (grass and crops: corn, wheat and oats), collected on the same locations (households), are analysed for the contents of radionuclides on an HPGe detector (Ortec, relative efficiency 23%) by standard gamma spectrometry. The content of Hg, Pb and Cd in feed is determined by standard atomic absorption spectrometry on the VarianSpectra220/ThermoSolar GFS97 spectrometer. Results Concentrations of 29 elements (Na, Al (P), Cl, K, Sc, Cr, Mn, Ni, Fe, Co, Zn, Se, As, Br, Sr, Rb, Sb, In, I, Ba, Cs, La, Nd, Eu, Sm, Tb, Hf, Ta and Th) are determined in blood of the examined animals. In feeds, natural ??K is found in all of the samples, cosmogenic ?Be and fission product ??Cs are detected only in the grass samples, while heavy metals Hg, Cd and Pb are found in the range of 0.01-0.02, 0.84-1.15 and 0.74-7.34 mg/kg, respectively. Calculated soil-to-blood transfer factors are in a wide range of 810?? to 64, as a result of varying significance of the elements in animal metabolism and feeding habits. Discussion The results of trace elements' concentrations in animal blood are in good agreement with available data for K, Ni, Zn, Se and Rb. Higher Br concentrations in animal blood are most probably caused by large biomass burning events during blood sampling. Very low concentration of Fe in cows and sheep confirms the results of previous biochemical studies on animal anaemia in the region. High concentration of As correlates with geochemical peculiarities of the Balkans and is also likely influenced by the use of pesticides in the agricultural production. For some of the elements (La, Nd, Eu, Sm, Tb, Sb, Hf, Ta, Th, In, Ba, Sr, Sc and Cs), there are few or no literature data. Therefore, some of the presented data are significant not only for the country and the region, but on a wider scale. Activities of natural radionuclides in feeds are within the average values reported for the region, while the activities of ??Pb and ?/?U are below the limit of detection. This is in accordance with previous investigations showing no widespread contamination by depleted uranium in the area. Contents of Hg and Pb in feeds are below the nationally permissible levels, unlike the content of Cd which exceeds it, probably caused by the use of phosphate fertilisers and fossil fuel combustion in the area. Conclusions In general, the concentrations of trace elements in blood of homebred cows and sheep are in good agreement with reference materials, available literature data and the results of previous studies in the area. The exceptions are Fe, As and Br. The contents of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides in feeds are within the expected levels, and there are no signs of contamination by depleted uranium or other fission products. Apart from Cd, there are no signs of pollution by heavy metals in feeds. The highly sensitive method of instrumental neutron activation analysis provides data on the concentration of some elements in animal blood not previously reported for the region and elsewhere. Recommendations and perspectives The presented study is a part of the long term ongoing project on the health risk assessment on animals and humans in the region. The collected data is intended to provide a base for the animal and human risk assessment as well as an estimate of the general pollution status of the environment in the region.

Escherichia coli were isolated in 2123 (94.7%), Enterococcus spp. in 2084 (92.9%), Yersinia spp. in 108 (4.8%) samples and Campylobacter sp., identified as C. hyointestinalis, in one sample only (0.04%). Neither Salmonella spp. nor Cryptosporidium-oocysts were detected. This study clearly shows that E. coli and Enterococcus spp. belong to the normal intestinal flora of healthy reindeer. However, only few of the isolated E. coli-strains possess genes encoding stx1 (0.14%), stx2 (0%), eae (0.52%) and hlyEHEC (0.99%), detected by PCR, that have the ability to cause health problems in humans and also animals. The isolated Yersinia spp. were further analysed for virulence factors, but examinations revealed no pathogenic strains. The public health risk due to excretion of important enteropathogenic microorganisms from reindeer has to be considered very low at present but a putative epidemiological threat to human health might arise when herding conditions are changed towards intensification and crowding.

Faecal samples from clinically healthy, semi-domesticated reindeer (n=2243) from northern regions of Finland and Norway were examined for important potentially enteropathogenic bacteria (Campylobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp.) and parasites (Cryptosporidium spp.) following standard procedures. Escherichia coli were isolated in 2123 (94.7%), Enterococcus spp. in 2084 (92.9%), Yersinia spp. in 108 (4.8%) samples and Campylobacter sp., identified as C. hyointestinalis, in one sample only (0.04%). Neither Salmonella spp. nor Cryptosporidium-oocysts were detected. This study clearly shows that E. coli and Enterococcus spp. belong to the normal intestinal flora of healthy reindeer. However, only few of the isolated E. coli-strains possess genes encoding stx1 (0.14%), stx2 (0%), eae (0.52%) and hlyEHEC (0.99%), detected by PCR, that have the ability to cause health problems in humans and also animals. The isolated Yersinia spp. were further analysed for virulence factors, but examinations revealed no pathogenic strains. The public health risk due to excretion of important enteropathogenic microorganisms from reindeer has to be considered very low at present but a putative epidemiological threat to human health might arise when herding conditions are changed towards intensification and crowding. This study was performed as part of the EU-project RENMAN (www.urova.fi/home/renman/).</p></span></span></span><p align="left">&nbsp;</p></span>Abstract in Norwegian / Sammendrag: Det er mangelfull kunnskap om hvorvidt det i reinm&oslash;kk kan finnes mikroorganismer som kan representere en helserisiko for dyr og mennesker.

Within the EU-project SAFIR new water-saving irrigation strategies were developed based on pot, semi-field and field experiments with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and processing tomatoes as model plants. From the pot and semi-field experiments an ABA production model was developed for potatoes to optimize the ABA signalling; this was obtained by modelling the optimal level of soil drying for ABA production before re-irrigation in a crop growth model. The field irrigation guidelines were developed under temperate (Denmark), Mediterranean (Greece, Italy) and continental (Serbia, China) climatic conditions during summer. The field investigations on processing tomatoes were undertaken only in the Po valley (North Italy) on fine, textured soil. The investigations from several studies showed that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation (DI) or partial root zone drying irrigation (PRD) induced hydraulic and chemical signals from the root system resulting in partial stomatal closure, an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency, and a slight reduction in top vegetative growth. Further PRD increased N-mineralization significantly beyond that from DI, causing a stay-green effect late in the growing season. In field potato and tomato experiments the water-saving irrigation strategies DI and PRD were able to save about 20-30% of the water used in fully irrigated plants. PRD increased marketable yield in potatoes significantly by 15% due to improved tuber size distribution. PRD increased antioxidant content significantly by approximately 10% in both potatoes and fresh tomatoes. Under a high temperature regime, full irrigation (FI) should be undertaken, as was clear from field observations in tomatoes. For tomatoes full irrigation should be undertaken for cooling effects when the night/day average temperature >26.5C or when air temperature >40C to avoid flower-dropping. The temperature threshold for potatoes is not clear. From three-year field drip irrigation experiments we found that under the establishment phase, both potatoes and tomatoes should be fully irrigated; however, during the later phases deficit irrigation might be applied as outlined below without causing significant yield reduction:  Potatoes ? After the end of tuber initiation, DI or PRD is applied at 70% of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50% of FI.  Fresh tomatoes ? From the moment the 1st truce is developed, DI is applied at 85-80% of FI for two weeks. In the middle period, DI or PRD is applied at 70% of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50% of FI.  Processing tomatoes ? From transplanting to fruit setting at 4th-5th cluster, the PRD and DI threshold for re-irrigation is when the plant-available soil water content (ASWC) equals 0.7 (soil water potential,  soil =?90kPa). During the late fruit development/ripening stage, 10% of red fruits, the threshold for re-irrigation for DI is when ASWC=0.5 ( soil =?185kPa) and for PRD when ASWC (dry side)=0.4 ( soil, dry side =?270kPa).

From transplanting to fruit setting at 4th-5th cluster, the PRD and DI threshold for re-irrigation is when the plant-available soil water content (ASWC) equals 0.7 (soil water potential,  soil =?90kPa). During the late fruit development/ripening stage, 10% of red fruits, the threshold for re-irrigation for DI is when ASWC=0.5 ( soil =?185kPa) and for PRD when ASWC (dry side)=0.4 ( soil, dry side =?270kPa).

Within the EU-project SAFIR new water-saving irrigation strategies were developed based on pot, semi-field and field experiments with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and processing tomatoes as model plants. From the pot and semi-field experiments an ABA production model was developed for potatoes to optimize the ABA signalling; this was obtained by modelling the optimal level of soil drying for ABA production before re-irrigation in a crop growth model. The field irrigation guidelines were developed under temperate (Denmark), Mediterranean (Greece, Italy) and continental (Serbia, China) climatic conditions during summer. The field investigations on processing tomatoes were undertaken only in the Po valley (North Italy) on fine, textured soil. The investigations from several studies showed that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation (DI) or partial root zone drying irrigation (PRD) induced hydraulic and chemical signals from the root system resulting in partial stomatal closure, an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency, and a slight reduction in top vegetative growth. Further PRD increased N-mineralization significantly beyond that from DI, causing a stay-green effect late in the growing season. In field potato and tomato experiments the water-saving irrigation strategies DI and PRD were able to save about 20-30% of the water used in fully irrigated plants. PRD increased marketable yield in potatoes significantly by 15% due to improved tuber size distribution. PRD increased antioxidant content significantly by approximately 10% in both potatoes and fresh tomatoes. Under a high temperature regime, full irrigation (FI) should be undertaken, as was clear from field observations in tomatoes. For tomatoes full irrigation should be undertaken for cooling effects when the night/day average temperature >26.5C or when air temperature >40C to avoid flower-dropping. The temperature threshold for potatoes is not clear. From three-year field drip irrigation experiments we found that under the establishment phase, both potatoes and tomatoes should be fully irrigated; however, during the later phases deficit irrigation might be applied as outlined below without causing significant yield reduction:  Potatoes ?

The aim of this study is to investigate the seasonal and spatial variance of organic micropollutants in small fresh water streams and to identify possible sources and sinks. Therefore four small freshwater river systems in Hesse, Germany, have been investigated with respect to common organic pollutants such as: the organophosphates tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP), the synthetic musk fragrances 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexa-methylcyclopenta-[g]-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN),  the endocrine disruptors bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and the technical isomer mixture of 4-nonylphenol (NP), the herbicide terbutryn [2-(t-butylamino)-4-(ethylamino)-6-(methylthio)-s-triazine] as well as the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). Water samples were collected in the time span from September 2003 to September 2006 at 26 sampling locations. The samples were extracted with solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For quantification the internal standard method was used. The results of the study showed an ubiquitous occurrence of organic pollutants in the fresh water streams of the study area. The organophosphates have been detected in 90 % of the water samples with mean concentrations of 502 ng/l (TCPP), 276 ng/l (TBP), 183 ng/l (TBEP), 118 ng/l (TCEP) and 117 ng/l (TDCPP). Sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents were identified as the dominating source for the chlorinated organophosphates as well as for the synthetic musk fragrances and the insect repellent DEET in the river systems. Consequently the highest concentrations were observed in the Schwarzbach system characterized by the highest proportion of waste water compared to the other river systems. Mean concentration levels of the synthetic musk fragrances HHCB and ATHN were 141 ng/l and 46 ng/l, respectively and 124 ng/l in case of DEET.  The synthetic musk fragrances showed a clear seasonal trend with significantly lower concentrations in summer times compared to winter times, which is ascribed to stronger photodegradation and volatization during summer times. In contrast, mean DEET concentrations and loads were significantly higher in summer than in autumn, winter and spring, in parallel with the main insect season.The concentrations of the endocrine disruptors BPA, NP and OP in the river water samples ranged from <20 ng/l to 1927 ng/l, <10 ng/l to 770 ng/l, and <10 ng/l to 420 ng/l, respectively. Whereas OP was present in about 2/3 of the samples, NP and BPA could only be detected in 56% and 13% of the water samples, respectively. BPA levels exceeded in two samples the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for water organisms. In case of NP, highest concentrations and loads were found in September 2003 and decreased significantly since then. In contrast, concentrations and loads of OP which serves in a similar application field remained nearly constant during the sampling period.  The decrease of NP can be attributed to the implementation of the European Directive 2003/53/EG, which restricts the use of nonylphenols and nonylphenol ethoxylates since January 2005. However, at the end of the sampling period in September 2006, NP could still be detected at mean concentrations of 18 ng/l in the river waters of the sampling area. Furthermore, absence of NP in several samples from associated STP effluents indicate that the STPs cannot be the only sources for NP found in the river water.The herbicide terbutryn was present in the rivers during the whole sampling period from September 2003 to September 2006 despite a ban on its use as a herbicide from January 2004 on. Terbutryn levels ranged from < 4 ng/l to 5600 ng/l, showing a clear spatial pattern with high terbutryn concentrations in the Weschnitz and Modau river systems and significantly lower terbutryn levels in Schwarzbach and Winkelbach. Results from the analysis of two STP effluents discharging into the Weschnitz and the Modau, respectively, indicate that terbutryn enters the rivers from this source. Furthermore, terbutryn concentrations and loads showed a clear seasonal trend with significantly higher levels in summer and autumn. Obviously, the ban on agricultural use of terbutryn at the end of 2003 had no discernable influence on terbutryn concentration in the rivers because there was no trend of decreasing.ags:ARN="AV20120164578" , 187020  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/187020_en.html , The present study was elaborated within the scope of the INTAFERE (Integrated Analysis of Mobile Organic Foreign Substances in Rivers) project which investigates the occurrence of xenobiotics in small freshwater streams with particular consideration of social impact factors. The aim of this study is to investigate the seasonal and spatial variance of organic micropollutants in small fresh water streams and to identify possible sources and sinks. Therefore four small freshwater river systems in Hesse, Germany, have been investigated with respect to common organic pollutants such as: the organophosphates tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP), the synthetic musk fragrances 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexa-methylcyclopenta-[g]-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN),  the endocrine disruptors bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and the technical isomer mixture of 4-nonylphenol (NP), the herbicide terbutryn [2-(t-butylamino)-4-(ethylamino)-6-(methylthio)-s-triazine] as well as the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). Water samples were collected in the time span from September 2003 to September 2006 at 26 sampling locations. The samples were extracted with solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For quantification the internal standard method was used.

Management unit for these conceptions is forest stand. But for all traditional concepts of silviculture and forest management, it is possible to establish new higher level of quality employing geoinformation technologies in relation to models, methods and tools for decision support. They are integral part of precision forestry. It is also possible to precise detail level from stand to individual tree. Precision forestry uses high technology sensing and analytical tools to support site specific economic, environmental and sustainable decision making for forestry sectors supporting the forestry value chain. It provides additional quality information about forests and the manufacturing forestry products for maximizing economic return within accepting current constrains. It provides tools to make good decisions and highly repeatedly measurements to take accurate actions and processes to initiate, cultivate and harvest trees, enhances biodiversity and other environmental resources. Precision forestry comprises also planning and performing site specific management activities and operations for increasing quality of wood and forest products, increasing of incorne and sustainable environment quality. There are plenty of scientific and research initiatives existing in Europe in this field. Very good example is the MOTIVE project (MOdels for AdapTIVE forest Management). It is a large-scale integrated project in the 7th Framework Programme of the EU that evaluates the consequences of the intensified competition for forest resources specific  cIimate and land use change.

The tool, which implements the biophysical model EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) and data sources readily available for the member countries of EU25 is aimed to support decision making in EU environmental policy. It is an integrated part of the INSEA FP6-project (Integrated Sink Enhancement Assessment) focusing on modelling of carbon sequestration potentials and greenhouse gases emissions from agricultural land under different land use management, and land use changes. The analysis quantifies environmental impacts and potentials of converting conventional tillage systems (i.e. mouldboard ploughing) to reduced or minimum tillage systems. Impacts on soil organic carbon in the topsoil (0-30 cm) and crop yields are modelled for a time horizon of 10 years. The model predicts an average increase of soil organic carbon between 1.7 and 2.5 % for reduced tillage, and between 2.9 and 4.4 % for minimum tillage compared to a continuation of conventional tillage. The impact of alternative management systems on crop yields is modest negative with the highest impact for minimum tillage systems (9.9 % on average) and followed by reduced tillage (4.2 % on average). It is necessary to notice that the modelling of environmental impacts is based on rough, and in many cases insufficient data on landscape and its utilisation. However, it should illustrate how EU data sources could be integrated and processed to support environmental policy making in EU member states, and that further efforts in input data validation and processing are needed.ags:ARN="RS2012001489" , 87962  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/87962_en.html , There is an urgent need to study in Europe the plant exposure to mycotoxin risk due to the identification of new toxigenic species, the continuous evolution of species profile on the food crops and climate changes that influence the quality of level of toxigenic fungi colonization of plant hosts. In particular, Fusarium and Aspergillus problem in Europe has enormous importance; recent epidemics in wheat in some areas of Northern and Central Europe and in grape in southern Europe have brought this problem into focus again. This concern has driven many efforts at EU level aimed to harmonize strategies for mycotoxinreduction in food and feed chain. This is the target of a large collaborative project of four-year duration (MYCORED as acronym), that was approved within the European FP7- Food, Agriculture, and Biotechnologies Work Programmes (www.mycored.eu). MYCORED aims to develop strategic solutions for reducing mycotoxin contamination in major crops. Novel methodologies, efficient handling procedures and information/dissemination, and educational strategies are considered in a context of multidisciplinary integration of know-how and technology to reduce mycotoxin exposure worldwide. The direct involvement of ICPC countries (Argentina, Egypt, Russia, South Africa) and international organizations (CIMMYT, IITA) together with strong scientific alliances with international experts and national and international societies for mycotoxicology is a strong point of the project through sharing experiences and resources from several past/ongoing mycotoxin projects in a global context. Similarly, the International Society for Mycotoxicology (ISM) (http://www.mycotoxsociety. org) aims at increasing scientific knowledge concerning biology, chemistry and any sciences/disciplines related to mycotoxins and toxigenic fungi, through membership networking, scientific meetings, symposia, discussions, technical courses and publications.

The direct involvement of ICPC countries (Argentina, Egypt, Russia, South Africa) and international organizations (CIMMYT, IITA) together with strong scientific alliances with international experts and national and international societies for mycotoxicology is a strong point of the project through sharing experiences and resources from several past/ongoing mycotoxin projects in a global context. Similarly, the International Society for Mycotoxicology (ISM) (http://www.mycotoxsociety. org) aims at increasing scientific knowledge concerning biology, chemistry and any sciences/disciplines related to mycotoxins and toxigenic fungi, through membership networking, scientific meetings, symposia, discussions, technical courses and publications. In this context, it would be extremely important that MYCORED and ISM develop a network of cooperation-interaction with the whole scientific community in order to contribute to the efforts for harmonizing both research and legislation on mycotoxins.ags:ARN="CS2004001327" , 103727  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/103727_en.html , This paper presents Research and Development Project of the  Serbian Ministry for Science, Technology and Development which had been found in the CORE group of EU-FP6/EoI projects. Project objective are renewable energy sources (RES-solar and geothermal energy, biomass and solid waste), their integration in buildings, and building's polyvalent facades multifunctional optimization (thermal behavior and thermal load control, daylighting and solar thermal as well as PV electricity production). In addition discussed is development of multimodel approach in energy efficiency optimization and sustainable buildings design (new generation of buildings simulations tools focusing on: increased cost effectiveness and reliability of RES systems utilization performance prediction). 'Polygeneration'/trigeneration of electricity, heating and cooling, through integration of RES in both urban and rural context (including agriculture), in commercial, residential and industrial buildings can enable approaching sustainable local and regional development.ags:ARN="CS2004001327" , 94471  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/94471_en.html , This paper presents Research and Development Project of the  Serbian Ministry for Science, Technology and Development which had been found in the CORE group of EU-FP6/EoI projects.

The decision making process underlying livelihood strategies, is sometimes regular and seasonal, and sometimes occasional and unexpected. This concept also stresses the importance of reducing vulnerability, enhancing environmental sustainability, and building on local strengths and priorities. It recognizes that rural households are active agents of change and pursue a range of livelihood strategies. The article used the results of the survey conducted within the Project Assessing the multiple Impacts of the Common Agricultural Policies CAP on Rural Economies CAP-IRE funded under FP7. The aim of this paper is to analyze and examine the impact of the development of CAP based on analysis of livelihood strategies of rural farm households. The ways strategies of making a living depend on the means. These are summarized in the so-called capital asset pentagon, or, as some call it, the livelihood platform. The capital assets normally mentioned for rural livelihoods are: physical capital, natural resources, financial capital, human capital and social capital. The analysis of the impact of CAP on the livelihood strategies of rural agricultural households was conducted in three areas: management of production factors in terms of own and rented arable land - natural resources, an analysis of employment - human capital and social capital. Livelihood outcomes result from livelihood strategies. Despite the declining share of employment in agriculture, agriculture remains an important source of income for many rural households, particularly in the poorest and most underdeveloped regions of new EU Member States. In this sense, the CAP impact on livelihood strategies of rural households.ags:ARN="CZ2013000076" , 96974  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96974_en.html , We assessed drought characteristics in the Republic of Moldova based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated from monthly precipitation data simulated by the Regional Climate Model RegCM3. The RegCM simulations were conducted at a horizontal resolution of 10 km in the framework of EU-FP6 project Central and Eastern Europe Climate Change Impact and Vulnerability Assessment (CECILIA). The domain was centered over Romania at 46 deg N, 25 deg E and included the Republic of Moldova. We validated the model ability to simulate monthly temperature and precipitation by comparing the model simulations forced by ERA40 with the observations from CRU TS2.0 dataset and station observations for the period 1961-1990. The RegCM simulations (control and scenario runs) forced with the ECHAM5 Global Circulation Model (GCM) have been corrected against the systematic errors induced by the GCM. After the bias correction, the annual cycle of temperature and precipitation is analyzed by comparing the model simulations conducted under A1B scenario for the periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 with the control run for the period 1961-1990. The characteristics of the drought for the current climate were assessed based on SPI calculated for 1-24 month lags from CRU dataset and station observations. The SPI for 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24-month lag was calculated and analyzed for RegCM simulations. The results show that the model underestimates the severity of droughts.ags:ARN="CZ2013000076" , 92164  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/92164_en.html , We assessed drought characteristics in the Republic of Moldova based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated from monthly precipitation data simulated by the Regional Climate Model RegCM3.

One of its tasks was to obtain basic information about the soil properties, which determine the resistance against air pollution. Because of no harmonized methodology, the results were only partially useful for the initial purpose. The European Parliament and Council Directive No. 2152/2003 on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions Forest Focus concentrates not only on forest protection against air pollution and forest fires, but also on the areas like soil research and biodiversity assessment. To close out this gap the European Commission supported launching in 2004 a joint international demonstration project BioSoil, which was aimed to provide a harmonized soil and biodiversity studies of the EU Member States. The major project objective regarding the soils was to obtain statistically reliable information about the forest soil properties, which is necessary to deal with a number of environmental issues, like acidification and or eutrophication, dynamics of the carbon content of soil, climate change, etc.; to develop standardized and harmonized soil monitoring methodology (ICP Forests Guides and other guidance); to improve quality of the existing European forest soil database; and to identify and explain as far as possible temporal changes in forest soils. Statistical inventory of forest soils involved sampling forest soils from 0 to 80 cm deep, including the humus (O) horizon. In Latvia, the BioSoil project involved 95 ICP Forests monitoring plots of Level 1, distributed across the country in a regular 16 x 16 km grid. The soil samples for composite sample analyses were taken from 1 m deep pits (8 per sample plot). As the ICP Forests soil sampling method provides, the composite samples were taken from Horizon O (if present), 0...10 cm, 10...20 cm, 20...40 cm and 40...80 cm deep. Two sets of composite samples were collected in each plot  one set of certain volume (24 x 100 cm3 from each layer from 0...80 cm deep, and 24 samples of certain area (100 cm2) from the humus layer for bulk density and texture analyses, and another set for chemical analyses. Soil samples were prepared for analyses according to LVS ISO 11464 Standard. Fine earth fraction of soil (? is less than 2 mm) was used for chemical and texture analyses according to LVS ISO 11464, 2005. For composite samples the following parameters were determined: texture according to LVS ISO 11277, 2000; pH in water extraction according to LVS ISO 10390, 2002; carbonate according to LVS ISO 10693: 1995, 1999, total carbon (C) according to LECO, 1987 and calculated organic carbon (Corg.); total nitrogen (Ntot.) according to LVS ISO 11261, 2002. All the results were validated according to the validity tables provided by the ICP Forests. Calculations of the carbon stock of forest soils were made separately for the organic soils and mineral soils, using average thickness of litter layer, density and organic carbon content. This article deals with the results of analyses for soil acidity, texture, organic (Corg.) and total nitrogen (Ntot). Within the scope of this study signifi cant differences were found in pH H2O, texture and concentration of nitrogen in O horizon, as well as in the organic and mineral soil layers in forest stands with different dominant species. There is a correlation between dominant specie, site index, and content of clay particles in soil. Spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) grows better in loamy soils (clay content 7...10%). Horizon O of forest soils is moderately to strongly acidic. The most acidic conditions were found in pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. Content of total nitrogen in Horizon O depends on species composition of the stand as well as on the origin of soil material (organic or mineral). The highest content of total nitrogen was found in spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) and pine stands in Horizon O, which overlays organic soil. In Latvia the content of organic carbon in soil (0...80 cm deep) and Horizon O in forest soils is 754 +- 185 mill. t. This means that organic carbon stock in soil is considerably higher than in living biomass and therefore soil is a highly important element of natural carbon sequestration and as such it should be monitored and protected at least with the same care as the living forest biomass.ags:ARN="LV2010000232" , 91218  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/91218_en.html , The first EC scale forest soil inventory was implemented in the late 1990s within the ICP Forest Initiative.

The development of the sugar industry began in the 18th century thanks to imports of sugarcane from overseas colonies. The production of sugar beet was initiated by Napoleon Bonaparte in the beginning of the 19th century. The industrial revolution contributed to the rationalization of production and helped France become the European leader. In the 1960s, France contributed to the Common Agricultural Policy project. The year 1968, when the CMO was founded, was important for the whole sugar industry. One of the reasons for growing market concentration became the principle of quota management. In 2006, a major reform of the EU sugar policy was implemented and this reform strengthened France's leading position on the sugar market. Nowadays, France is the world's 7th largest sugar producer and is number one in sugar beet production. For France, sugar is an important export article; the share of export on total production represents 45 %. The French sugar market is concentrated and dominated by three international groups. French specific is cooperative ownership and internationalization of sugar companies.ags:ARN="AV2012081837" , 87458  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/87458_en.html , New Connections is a directory of Irish participation in EU funded marine research projects over the period 2007-2010.

It is a 4 years program started in January 2008, and is currently supported by 22 institutions from Europe and South-East Asia. The objective is to increase the quality, quantity, profile and impact of bi-regional Science and Technology cooperation between the 10 ASEAN countries and the Members and Associated States of the European Union. Every Thematic Priority of FP7 has to implement dedicated international cooperation activities to achieve the program's goals and to address specific problems of 'Third Countries/Regions' (non-EU Members States or non-Associated States).

Therefore, solar energy is a real alternative, as it supplies virtually unlimited energy. Solar desalination could be an ideal solution for isolated areas which receive high solar irradiation per day. Solar Membrane Distillation (MD) is a developing technology particularly interesting for small supplies, isolated populations and autonomous systems. As it is a low temperature operation process, MD is very suitable for integration with thermal solar systems and/or waste heat recovery units; in contrast to other desalination technologies, only a coarse filtration of the water is required as pretreatment. However, the commercial availability is currently quite limited. This paper presents the promising 5-year experience and data analysis of a solar compact MD demonstration plant installed in the facilities of the Instituto Tecnol?gico de Canarias (ITC) in Playa de Pozo Izquierdo (Gran Canary Island-Spain). The unit was designed and installed at the end of 2004 as part of a co-funded FP6 DGTREN research project called Development of stand-alone, solar thermally driven and PV-supplied desalination systems based on innovative membrane distillation (MEMDIS) and has been continuously tested within the FP7 EU co-funded project called MEmbrane DIstillation in Remote AreaS  MEDIRAS.ags:ARN="US201500090759" , 90319  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/90319_en.html , Desalination is a technology with a high energy demand, mainly supplied by fossil sources. Therefore, solar energy is a real alternative, as it supplies virtually unlimited energy. Solar desalination could be an ideal solution for isolated areas which receive high solar irradiation per day. Solar Membrane Distillation (MD) is a developing technology particularly interesting for small supplies, isolated populations and autonomous systems. As it is a low temperature operation process, MD is very suitable for integration with thermal solar systems and/or waste heat recovery units; in contrast to other desalination technologies, only a coarse filtration of the water is required as pretreatment. However, the commercial availability is currently quite limited.

Such an integrated management promotes sustainable development based on achieving a balance of environmental, social and economic objectives. Here we introduce a first draft of a generic framework which is developed in the EU FP7 project MESMA that gives guidance on how to assess the effectiveness of an existing management within a spatially defined area. More precisely, we define spatially managed areas as geographical entities where a marine planning framework is or will be used to manage multiple human activities in space and time while aiming to maintain ecosystem integrity. The framework consists of seven steps and comprises practical guidance on the selection of operational objectives and related criteria (step 1), the collation and integration of information (steps 2, 3 and 4), performance assessment (step 5), and feedback processes (steps 6 and 7). In the course of the MESMA project, this generic framework will be applied and tested in nine case studies, representing all European seas. Here we highlight the processes and practical tasks involved in each of the framework steps, reflect on the first attempts to implement this framework and identify the requirements for practical tools such as standardized methods to map human activities and assess their cumulative impacts.ags:ARN="AV2012057603" , 92591  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/92591_en.html , The application of an ecosystem approach to management of the sea requires both integrated and strategic frameworks such as Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and the use of marine spatial planning (MSP) to minimize spatial use conflicts and environmental degradation.

The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Flood Risk from Extreme Events (FREE) project, Coastal Flooding by Extreme Events and EU FP7 Morphological Impacts and Coastal Risks Induced by Extreme Storm Events project are investigating the flood risks in the eastern Irish Sea, an area that includes most of England's coastal types. Using a previously modelled and validated historical extreme surge event, in November 1977, we now investigate the changes in peak surge as a result of possible future climate conditions. In order to simulate the surge, we have set up a one-way nested approach, using the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System 3D baroclinic model, from a domain covering the whole NW European continental shelf, through to a 1.85 km Irish Sea model; both areas are forced by tides, atmospheric pressure and winds. We use this modelling system to investigate the impact of enhanced wind velocities and increased sea levels on the peak surge elevation and residual current pattern.

In the EU FP7 project BioBio, we studied the effect of organic farming on species numbers at farm level on 169 randomly selected organic and non-organic farms with mostly low to medium intensity in ten European regions. Using a preferential sampling scheme based on habitat mapping, numbers of plants, earthworms, spiders and bees were assessed at farm level. A global analysis across the ten regions shows that organic farms have significantly higher numbers of plant and bee species than non-organic farms. The effect of organic farming on earthworm and spider species numbers are also positive but insignificant. The effects in absolute terms are small and much smaller than the variation between individual farms. Currently ongoing analyses aim at identifying the important driving factors for farmland biodiversity.ags:ARN="AV2012093981" , 85421  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/85421_en.html , Fostered by and embedded in the general development of information and communications technology (ICT), the evolution of tsunami warning systems (TWS) shows a significant development from seismic-centred to multi-sensor system architectures using additional sensors (e.g. tide gauges and buoys) for the detection of tsunami waves in the ocean. <br><br> Currently, the beginning implementation of regional tsunami warning infrastructures indicates a new phase in the development of TWS.

A combination of geophysical methods and direct push techniques for contaminated land characterization has been proposed within the EU FP7 project ModelPROBE and the affiliated project SoilCAM. In this paper, we present results of the investigations conducted at the Trecate field site (NW Italy), which was affected in 1994 by crude oil contamination. The less invasive investigations include ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys, together with direct push sampling and soil electrical conductivity (EC) logs. Many of the geophysical measurements were conducted in time-lapse mode in order to separate static and dynamic signals, the latter being linked to strong seasonal changes in water table elevations. The main challenge was to extract significant geophysical signals linked to contamination from the mix of geological and hydrological signals present at the site. The most significant aspects of this characterization are: (a) the geometrical link between the distribution of contamination and the sites heterogeneity, with particular regard to the presence of less permeable layers, as evidenced by the extensive surface geophysical measurements; and (b) the link between contamination and specific geophysical signals, particularly evident from cross-hole measurements. The extensive work conducted at the Trecate site shows how a combination of direct (e.g., chemical) and indirect (e.g., geophysical) investigations can lead to a comprehensive and solid understanding of a contaminated sites mechanisms.ags:ARN="US201400142002" , 89332  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/89332_en.html , The characterization of contaminated sites can benefit from the supplementation of direct investigations with a set of less invasive and more extensive measurements.

Earth Observation (EO) data offers a potential solution to long-term biodiversity monitoring through direct mapping of habitats or by integrating Land Cover/Use (LC/LU) maps with contextual spatial information and in situ data. Therefore, it appears necessary to develop an automatic/semi-automatic translation framework of LC/LU classes to habitat classes, but also challenging due to discrepancies in domain definitions. In the context of the FP7 BIO_SOS ( www.biosos.eu ) project, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of the Food and Agricultural Organization Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy to habitat class translation. They also developed a framework to automatically translate LCCS classes into the recently proposed General Habitat Categories classification system, able to provide an exhaustive typology of habitat types, ranging from natural ecosystems to urban areas around the globe. However discrepancies in terminology, plant height criteria and basic principles between the two mapping domains inducing a number of one-to-many and many-to-many relations were identified, revealing the need of additional ecological expert knowledge to resolve the ambiguities. This paper illustrates how class phenology, class topological arrangement in the landscape, class spectral signature from multi-temporal Very High spatial Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and plant height measurements can be used to resolve such ambiguities. Concerning plant height, this paper also compares the mapping results obtained by using accurate values extracted from LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data and by exploiting EO data texture features (i.e. entropy) as a proxy of plant height information, when LIDAR data are not available.

Food safety experts from various stakeholder types in the farm-to-fork chain were represented: farmer related organizations (n=6), fresh produce processing and trading companies (n=17), retail (n=3), consumer organizations (n=2), competent authorities (n=7) and lastly research institutes and universities (n=19). The experts who originated mainly from European countries (92.6%) were grouped in nine discussion groups per type of stakeholder and asked to rank food safety issues via a scoring approach according to perceived importance from their stakeholder type point of view. Also information sources for opinion making, appropriate food safety control measures and perceived contextual factors increasingly challenging governance of food safety in fresh produce were ranked according to perceived importance. Although some differences were noted between opinions of the different stakeholders, there was in general an agreement on the main priorities in food safety of fresh produce. Bacterial pathogens were overall considered to be the most important food safety issue for fresh produce, followed by foodborne viruses, pesticide residues and mycotoxins. Alert systems such as the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) were considered as the most important source of information of food safety issues, followed by reports of international organizations (e.g. WHO, EFSA), legislative documents (e.g. EU legislation), national reports (e.g. on monitoring hazards, foodborne outbreaks) and exchange of information between people (informal contacts). Concerning the control measures, the application of good agricultural practices (GAP) was identified to be the most important control measure to assure the safety of fresh produce, followed by the application of good hygienic practices (GHP) and the certification of food safety management systems (FSMS). Increasing international trade and globalization were overall expected to have a large impact on food safety in fresh produce. Other contextual factors perceived to be important were the food safety policies by governments and the (lack of) food safety knowledge by consumers and other stakeholders of the fresh produce supply chain. Although the various stakeholder groups may conceive issues differently from their proper position in the fresh produce supply chain, no deep disagreements emerged. This type of workshop enhances interaction and risk communication between stakeholders and contributes to a better understanding of each other's concerns, constraints and interests to deal with the food safety of the increasingly complex and globalized fresh produce supply chain.ags:ARN="US201400187085" , 96974  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96974_en.html , PURPOSE: As capture fishery production has reached its limits and global demand for aquatic products is still increasing, aquaculture has become the worlds fastest growing animal production sector. In attempts to evaluate the environmental consequences of this rapid expansion, life cycle assessment (LCA) has become a frequently used method. The present review of current peer-reviewed literature focusing on LCA of aquaculture systems is intended to clarify the methodological choices made, identify possible data gaps, and provide recommendations for future development within this field of research. The results of this review will also serve as a start-up activity of the EU FP7 SEAT (Sustaining Ethical Aquaculture Trade) project, which aims to perform several LCA studies on aquaculture systems in Asia over the next few years. METHODS: From a full analysis of methodology in LCA, six phases were identified to differ the most amongst ten peer-reviewed articles and two PhD theses (functional unit, system boundaries, data and data quality, allocation, impact assessment methods, interpretation methods). Each phase is discussed with regards to differences amongst the studies, current LCA literature followed by recommendations where appropriate. The conclusions and recommendations section reflects on aquaculture-specific scenarios as well as on some more general issues in LCA. RESULTS: Aquaculture LCAs often require large system boundaries, including fisheries, agriculture, and livestock production systems from around the globe. The reviewed studies offered limited coverage of production in developing countries, low-intensity farming practices, and non-finfish species, although most farmed aquatic products originate from a wide range of farming practices in Asia. Apart from different choices of functional unit, system boundaries and impact assessment methods, the studies also differed in their choice of allocation factors and data sourcing. Interpretation of results also differed amongst the studies, and a number of methodological choices were identified influencing the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Efforts should be made to increase transparency to allow the results to be reproduced, and to construct aquaculture related database(s). More extensive data reporting, including environmental flows, within the greater field of LCA could be achieved, without compromising the focus of studies, by providing supporting information to articles and/or reporting only ID numbers from background databases.

For this purpose a multicriteria model was formulated, at farm household level, in order to study the social impacts of the CAPs using different scenarios. The scenarios were chosen on the basis of the main EU policies affecting farm households, such as the alternative crops scenario, the Water Framework Directive scenario and the agrienvironmental schemes scenario. The data for this analysis resulted from the CAP-IRE project, a European FP7-funded project. The model includes a utility function with several conflicting criteria such as maximization of gross margin and risk and labour minimization. The model is further used to simulate the impacts on social sustainability by estimating main social indicators. The model is applied in two different farm types in Greece. The results show that the CAP scenarios have multiple social impacts on agricultural holdings, and particularly on the farm labour structure. These impacts have negative effect on social sustainability.ags:ARN="US201500003890" , 88424  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/88424_en.html , This paper aims to assess the impacts of household behaviour on social sustainability by simulating agricultural policy scenarios of the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

Therefore, biodiversity indicators are needed to solve the problem of the measurement feasibility. Even though the issue of cost and effectiveness is central for the evaluation of the indicators, only the latter is discussed in detail in the scientific literature. This work presents a cost analysis based on the direct gathering of records from a farm-scale biodiversity survey (EU-FP7, BioBio - Indicators for biodiversity in organic and low-input farming systems) where the analysis of costs is part of the project. It is a simple method for comparing different indicators by their ratio of cost/effectiveness.

Water quality in this deep-seated confined groundwater body is influenced by the intrusion of present-day seawater and pumping-induced upward migration of deeper saline groundwater. The aim of this study is to evaluate the threshold values applying the methodology worked out within the EU 6th FP project Background criteria for the identification of groundwater thresholds (BRIDGE) and to compare the results with the values proposed by local authorities. A database containing 250 monitoring points was completed and used for the calculation of natural background levels (as the 90 and 97.7 percentile) in groundwater. The calculation of threshold values is based on natural background levels and reference values. In case of Cambrian-Vendian groundwater body the receptor is drinking water, thus limit values set by Estonian drinking water standard were used as reference values. The threshold values proposed by local authorities are more or less the same as calculated by BRIDGE methodology.

The 90 percentile is proposed as natural background level (NBL) for the unconfined Pleistocene deposits, ascribing the outliers to possible influence of pollution. For the Tertiary aquifers, high values for different parameters have a natural origin and the 97.7 percentile is preferred as NBL.

Application of spatial data of different scales coupled with socio-economic data makes it possible to explore and test the understanding of land use change relations. In the EU-FP7 research project PASHMINA (Paradigm Shift modelling and innovative approaches), three storylines of future transportation paradigm shifts towards 2040 are created. These storylines are translated into spatial planning strategies and modelled using the cellular automata model LUCIA. For the modelling, an Eastern Danish case area was selected, comprising of the Copenhagen metropolitan area and its hinterland. The different scenarios are described using a range of different descriptive GIS datasets. These include mapping of accessibility based on public and private transportation, urban density and structure, and distribution of jobs and population. These indicators are then incorporated in the model calculations as factors determining urban development, related to the scenario outlines. The results calculated from the scenarios reveals the great difference in urban distribution that different spatial planning strategies can produce, changing the shape of the urban landscape. The scenarios visualized showed to outline different planning strategies that could be implemented, creating a more homogenous urban structure targeted at a reduction of transportation work and thus energy consumption. This will lead to less impact on climate from transportation based on a more optimal localization and transport infrastructure strategy.ags:ARN="US201500202696" , 105734  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/105734_en.html , The modelling of land use change is a way to analyse future scenarios by modelling different pathways.

This article seeks to assess two recently implemented EU directives on environmental issues in light of this aim, namely the directives on Air Quality Management and Strategic Environmental Assessment. Drawing on theoretical foundations and empirical evidence from the EU FP6 project Governance for Sustainability, this article seeks to understand how policy integration is a matter of knowledge use, which is again related to the governance arrangements in which implementation takes place. Drawing on a total of 15 case studies in nine countries, the article finds that actual decision-making practice varies a lot albeit based on the same directives. In many cases, the directives were viewed as a sectoral environmental tools, and these cases were often dominated by expert knowledge being funnelled through relatively closed, hierarchical governance arrangements. In other cases, however, the directives were viewed as opportunities for politicians to cultivate a network mode of governance that aspired to arguing and sometimes opened up for competing knowledge claims.ags:ARN="US201400160326" , 96974  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96974_en.html , PURPOSE: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 99? % of companies operating in the European food and drink industry and, often, are part of highly fragmented and complex food chains. The article focuses on the development of a social impact assessment methodology for SMEs in selected food and drink products as part of the EU-FP7 SENSE research project. The proposed methodology employs a top-down and bottom-up approach and focuses on labour rights/working conditions along the product supply chain as the key social impact indicator, limiting key stakeholder classification to workers/employees and local communities impacted by the production process. Problems related to this emerging field are discussed, and questions for further research are expounded. METHODS: The article reviews both academic and grey literature on life cycle assessment (LCA) and its relationship to social LCA (S-LCA) and SMEs at the beginning of 2013 and includes case study evidence from the food sector. A pilot questionnaire survey sent to European food and drink sector SMEs and trade associations (as partners in the research project) about their knowledge, experience and engagement with social impacts is presented. Proposals are elaborated for a social impact assessment methodology that identifies the key data for SMEs to collect. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature reveals the complexity of the S-LCA approach as it aims to unite disparate and often conflicting interests. Findings from the pilot questionnaire are discussed. Using a top-down and bottom-up approach, the proposed methodology assesses data from SMEs along the supply chain in order to gauge social improvements in the management of labour-related issues for different product sectors. Issues relating to the attributional choice of a social impact indicator and key stakeholder categories are discussed. How scoring is interpreted and reported and what the intended effect of its use will be are also elaborated upon. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst recognising the difficulty of devising a robust social impact assessment for SMEs in the food and drink sector, it is argued that the proposed methodology makes a useful contribution in this fast-emerging field.ags:ARN="US201400160326" , 109807  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/109807_en.html , PURPOSE: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 99? % of companies operating in the European food and drink industry and, often, are part of highly fragmented and complex food chains.

This decision tool formed the basis of a recent EU research project, BENEFISH which was funded via the European Commission's Sixth Framework (FP6) initiative. The bio-economic decision model can incorporate biological data, productivity data, micro (farm) and macro (industry) level economic data, and consumer marketing and business to business data. It can identify areas for potential added value that might be achieved by improving fish welfare across a range of species and husbandry systems within European aquaculture. This article provides a brief overview of the minimum data requirements for successfully modeling the bio-economic impacts of improvements in farmed fish welfare using the model developed during the BENEFISH project. It also highlights potential bottlenecks and the minimum prerequisites for each potential data set to be used for successful modeling.ags:ARN="US201301604661" , 87955  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/87955_en.html , PRATIQUE is an EC-funded 7th Framework research project designed to address the major challenges for pest risk analysis (PRA) in Europe.

Regulation constraining carbon emissions has spawned an emerging carbon market that was valued at US$64 billion (Euro 47 billion) in 2007. Its biggest success so far has been to send market signals for the price of mitigating carbon emissions. This, in turn, has stimulated innovation and carbon abatement worldwide, as motivated individuals, communities, companies and governments have cooperated to reduce emissions. The European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) market has been successful in its mission of reducing emissions through internal abatement at home, and of stimulating emission reductions abroad. The European Commission, learning from the experience of Phase I, has strengthened several important design elements for EU ETS Phase II. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) accounted for the vast majority of project-based transactions (at 87 percent of volumes and 91percent of values) and JI saw transacted volumes doubling and values tripling in 2007 over the previous year.

As a result the national, annual chestnut production was reduced from 18,000 tons in the 1960s to 11,000 tons in 2005. A project for the application of biological control on a nationwide scale was funded and implemented during the period 2007-2009. Hypovirulent (hv) strains of Cryphonectria parasitica have been introduced by artificial inoculation into the 17 most important and most heavily infected chestnut growing prefectures. Four vc types were identified in the entire country, those of EU-1, EU-2, EU-10 with the dominant being EU-12 counting for 88%. Hypovirulent inoculum in the form of paste using the spontaneously appearing CHV-1 subtype 1 (Italian subtype) virus was prepared at the Forest Research Institute. It was specific for each prefecture and compatible with the local vc types of the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica according to a vc type distribution map that had been previously elaborated. Three million inoculations in total were made around developing cankers in three consecutive years by trained personnel. An evaluation conducted in 2011 showed that the hypovirulent strains which were introduced had established in all treated areas. Most importantly, the hypovirulent strains had started spreading from the inoculated cankers to non-inoculated ones. The extent of dissemination varied significantly among sampling plots within and among treated prefectures according to the management type (orchards, coppice or high forest), age of trees and horticultural or silvicultural practices applied.

A comparison of the test guidelines for drugs, agrochemicals and industrial chemicals shows that, for historical reasons, significantly different testing strategies are applied. The current status of development and validation of in vitro tests in reproductive toxicology is also critically evaluated. The mouse embryonic stem cell test (mEST) is the most advanced and promising of the in vitro tests. Although it has not yet been accepted for regulatory purposes, its use in preclinical drug development is well established. Moreover, promising molecular endpoints have been established in the mEST, including proteomic and toxicogenomic endpoints. Preliminary results have been obtained with a human EST (hEST). In addition, an overview is given on new in vitro reproductive toxicity tests that are currently being developed in the EU FP6 project, ReProTect, since the ReProTect test battery, which covers the essential steps of female and male fertility, implantation and embryotoxicity, holds promise for use as a screening assay for reproductive toxicity testing according to the EU REACH legislation. However, since validated in vitro methods will not be available in the short term, opportunities for the refinement of the standard in vivo tests are discussed, in order to reduce the numbers of animal used in reproductive toxicity testing. Finally, recommendations for toxicity testing in the 21st century call for the harmonisation of test methods across all areas of regulatory testing as a first step. Since the REACH system testing framework for industrial chemicals is driven by the reproductive safety testing requirements of agrochemicals, a shift is proposed to exposure-driven testing of industrial chemicals.

Bread baking is one of the most energy demanding processes (around 4MJ/kg), compared with other thermal processes such as canning. However, there is a large variability of data in the literature. For partial baking, bread has to be baked twice. It may also be frozen after part baking, which will increase the total energy demand. Results obtained with equipment used by craft bakeries are presented. Conventional and frozen part baked processes are compared. The effect of occupation ratio on the overall energy demand is also assessed. It was observed that 15-20% of the total energy is used for heating up the dough and 10-20% for crust drying. Pre-heating of the oven represents another significant energy demand. The energy demand for freezing is comparable to that for baking. An Energy Efficiency Index is used to assess the ratio of energy effectively transferred to the dough during baking. Part baked frozen technology demands about 2.2 times as much energy as conventional bread making process.ags:ARN="US201500009025" , 98504  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/98504_en.html , Human adenoviruses (HAdV) may be implicated in some disease outbreaks associated with recreational water exposures, typically in swimming pools. Modern molecular methods can be used to detect HAdV in environmental water samples. During the EU FP6 Project VIROBATHE a database of over 290 HAdV analyses with corresponding faecal indicator organism (FIO) determinations was gathered and used to explore statistical associations between HAdV and FIO results. The FIOs measured were Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and somatic coliphage. Statistically significant trends of increasing proportions of HAdV-positive results in categories of increasing FIO concentration were found in freshwater but not seawater samples. The analysis of these trends in freshwater samples was refined, the trends remaining statistically significant when using categories of 0.5log?? intervals of FIO concentration. Logistic regression models were then developed to predict the probability of a HAdV-positive outcome from FIO concentration. Potential applications of these models to predict the probability of HAdV-positive outcomes from routine FIO determinations used to describe recreational water quality exposures and to classify recreational water quality are discussed.ags:ARN="US201500009025" , 94954  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/94954_en.html , Human adenoviruses (HAdV) may be implicated in some disease outbreaks associated with recreational water exposures, typically in swimming pools.

Furthermore, it identified cost-efficient and value-adding use of biomass for energy and industry. The aims of this article are to provide a synthesis of the key results of this project. Estimated annual solid biomass potential in the EU-27 is almost 6600PJ (157Mtoe), of which 48% is currently utilised. The greatest potential for increased use lies in forest residues and herbaceous biomass. Trade barriers have been evaluated and some solutions suggested such as CN codes for wood pellets and price indexes for industrial wood pellets and wood chips. The analysis of wood pellet and wood chip prices revealed large difference amongst EU countries, but also that on the short term prices of woody and fossil fuels are barely correlated. Sustainable production and use of solid biomass are also deemed important by most European stakeholders, and many support the introduction of harmonised sustainability criteria, albeit under a number of preconditions. The study identified also that a number of woody and agro-industrial residue streams remain un- or underutilised. The estimated European total potential of agro-industrial sources is more than 250PJ (7.2Mtoe), the amount of unutilised woody biomass (the annual increment of growing stock) even amounts to 3150PJ (75Mtoe). Finally 35 case studies of biomass heating substituting fossil fuels were carried out, showing that the potential to reduce GHG emissions ranges between 90 and 98%, while costs are very similar to fossil fuel heating systems. Overall, we conclude that solid biomass is growing strongly, and is likely to heavily contribute to the EU renewable energy targets in the coming decade.ags:ARN="US201500126124" , 108791  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/108791_en.html , The EUBIONET III project has boosted (i) sustainable, transparent international biomass fuel trade, (ii) investments in best practice technologies and (iii) new services on biomass heat sector.

We believe this paper can be of high interest for both policy makers and researchers in the field of ecological indicators, as it brings clarity on most of the misconceptions and misunderstanding around Footprint indicators, their accounting frameworks, messages, and range of application.ags:ARN="AV2012048361" , 90717  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/90717_en.html , This manual describes the new European Fish Index  EFI+ - and its application software. The EFI+ software and manual have been developed within the EFI+ project. The EFI+ project was funded by the European Commission (EC) under the 6th Framework Programme, Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development, Key Action 1: Sustainable Management and Quality of Water of the European Commission (Specific Targeted Research Project FP6-2005-SSP-5-A, Task 4: Ecological status assessment  filling the gaps).In the year 2000, the EC adopted a new legislation, the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This new legislation, now implemented in 27 EU member countries, aims for good ecological conditions in all surface waters. Fishes are, for the first time, part of a European-wide monitoring network designed to assess the ecological status of running waters. Between 2001 and 2004 the EC funded the FAME project developed, evaluated and implemented new standardised fish-based methods to assess the ecological status of running waters in Europe (FP5, Energy, Environment and Sustainable Management. Key Action 1: Sustainable Management and Quality of Water, EVK1-CT-2001-00094, http://fame.boku.ac.at).The main output of the FAME project was the European Fish Index (EFI), the first standardised fish-based assessment method applicable across a wide range of European rivers. The EFI employs a number of environmental descriptors to predict biological reference conditions and then quantifies the deviation of the fish community structure from these reference conditions on a statistical basis. The EFI was developed mainly based on data from Western and Northern Europe and was calibrated against estimates of human pressures and impacts. Although a wide range of river types was included in the development of the EFI, some river types, e.g. very large rivers, were underrepresented.The EFI has now been tested by European countries within their national monitoring programmes and has been evaluated for use for reporting under the WFD. During this evaluation process a number of limitations were observed in the performance of the index. Therefore, the overall objective of the EFI+ project was to overcome the existing limitations of the EFI by developing a new, more accurate and pan-European fish index. The scientific and technological objectives were to (1) evaluate the applicability of the existing EFI and make necessary improvements in Central-Eastern Europe and Mediterranean ecoregions; (2) extend the scope of the existing EFI to cover large rivers; (3) analyse relationships between hydromorphological pressures (including continuity disruption) and fish assemblages to increase the accuracy of the EFI; (4) adapt the existing software to the requirements of the EFI+ to allow calculation of the ecological status for running waters.This manual is divided in two parts.Part I introduces the concepts and methods on which the EFI+ is based.

Although a wide range of river types was included in the development of the EFI, some river types, e.g. very large rivers, were underrepresented.The EFI has now been tested by European countries within their national monitoring programmes and has been evaluated for use for reporting under the WFD. During this evaluation process a number of limitations were observed in the performance of the index. Therefore, the overall objective of the EFI+ project was to overcome the existing limitations of the EFI by developing a new, more accurate and pan-European fish index. The scientific and technological objectives were to (1) evaluate the applicability of the existing EFI and make necessary improvements in Central-Eastern Europe and Mediterranean ecoregions; (2) extend the scope of the existing EFI to cover large rivers; (3) analyse relationships between hydromorphological pressures (including continuity disruption) and fish assemblages to increase the accuracy of the EFI; (4) adapt the existing software to the requirements of the EFI+ to allow calculation of the ecological status for running waters.This manual is divided in two parts.Part I introduces the concepts and methods on which the EFI+ is based. This section gives an overview of the development of the new European Fish Index and its achievements to fulfil the objectives of the Water Framework Directive in terms of using fishes as indicators for assessing the ecological status of running waters.Part II is the instruction manual to the web-based software. It details the fish assemblage and environmental data required and the process for obtaining scores and classification of the ecological status of a sampling site (or set of sampling sites) using the EFI+ online software.ags:ARN="RS2013060198" , 96974  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96974_en.html , In the framework of the NovelQ EU FP6 project, the consumer acceptance of novel technologies was studied by qualitative and quantitative methods. According to the research results the name ?Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) evokes the fear of electricity, thus not widely accepted. Prof. Dietrich Knorr, Chairman of the NovelQ Scientific Advisory Board thus proposed a new expression to replace PEF, namely micro pulse". The acceptance of the new terminology was studied focus group interviews. Three focus groups were organised with consumers (elderly age consumers, young adults and health conscious consumers) and one more focus group with experts of food sciences, specialised in technology, legislation, food policy, consumer sciences and nutrition sciences. The results of the focus group interviews with consumers highlighted, that name 'micro pulse' evokes better associations than the pulsed electric field and 'micro pulse' is in no way associated with 'electricity'. Consumers expressed their definite need of getting informed about the new technologies even if this leads to distrust because of the lack of comprehensive knowledge. Consumers judgment about the change of the technical term is diverse: according to the opinion of two focus groups, it is not misleading to use the name 'micro pulse' instead of PEF, though the electrical feature of the treatment should be mentioned. According to the respondents of the health conscious focus group, change of the name is misleading, because the aim is the reduction of consumers' fears. The most important issues rose by the expert focus group, namely that clear communication is essential for the consumers, and the electrical feature of the technology has to be expressed. The term ?pulsed electric field is threatening and ?micro pulse is not informative. The term ?micro electrical pulse might be acceptable according to the experts. It is important from the market point of view a new technology that it has to offer unambiguous benefits for the consumers. A communicational campaign is needed for the introduction of novel technologies.ags:ARN="RS2013060198" , 96180  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96180_en.html , In the framework of the NovelQ EU FP6 project, the consumer acceptance of novel technologies was studied by qualitative and quantitative methods.

Here, this link and its temporal evolution over France during the twentieth century is further investigated and related to the atmospheric circulation and North Atlantic/Mediterranean sea surface temperature (SST) patterns. Observational datasets of precipitation, mean sea level pressure (MSLP), atmospheric teleconnection patterns, and SST, as well as various global and regional climate model simulations are analyzed. The investigation of observed precipitation by means of a running correlation with a 30-year time window for the period 1901-present reveals a decreasing trend in the spring-to-autumn correlations, which become significantly negative in the second half of the twentieth century. These negative correlations are connected with similar spring-to-autumn correlations in observed MSLP, and with negatively correlated spring East Atlantic (EA) and autumn Scandinavian (SCA) teleconnection pattern indices. Maximum covariance analyses of SST with these atmospheric variables indicate that at least part of the identified spring-to-autumn link is mediated through SST, as spring precipitation and MSLP are connected with the same autumn SST pattern as are autumn precipitation, MSLP and the SCA pattern index. Except for ERA-40 driven regional climate models from the EU-FP6 project ENSEMBLES, the analyzed regional and global climate models, including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) simulations, do not capture this observed variability in precipitation. This is associated with the failure of most models in simulating the observed correlations between spring and autumn MSLP.

Due to low precipitation and therefore low water availability, water is a scarce resource and often the limiting factor for socio-economic development. The aim of this model study was to compare the uncertainties of hydrological modelling induced by global and regional climate data sets and to calculate the impacts on estimates of renewable water resources. Within this integrated model study the hydrological and water use model Water Global Assessment and Prognosis 3 (WaterGAP 3) is being applied to all river basins located in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia in five arc minutes spatial resolution (~6?9km/grid cell). The model was driven by different global and regional climate data sets to estimate their impact on modelled water resources in Central Asia. In detail, these are the global TS data set of the Climate Research Unit (CRU), the WATCH forcing data (WFD) developed within the EUFP6 Project WATer and global Change, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) Reanalysis product v6, and the regional Aphrodites Water Resources data set (Aphrodite). The performance of the model is then being evaluated by comparing modelled and observed river discharge for the time period 19712000. Finally, the uncertainties in modelled water availability induced by the different data sets are quantified to point out the consequences for water management. Over the entire region, mean and maximum annual precipitations given by the various data sets differ by 13% and up to 42%, respectively. In addition, considerable deviation of temporal dynamics is found in some locations, where a pairwise comparison showed poor agreement between CRU and GPCC/WFD (NashSutcliffe efficiency 0.27/0.23).

Yield prediction is a relevant pre-requisite for the EU and US commissions, shipper, retailer, fruit trade, marketing organisations and fruit grower. The objective of this joint project was to develop an alternative to the present yield prediction method based on manual visual fruit counting. The new scheme utilizes digital images with a resolution of at least 1280 ? 980 pixel. Digital images were taken in July of fully-grown apple trees on M.9 at Klein-Altendorf near Bonn, Germany and other sites in Europe with different crop loads. Image analysis was employed to predict yield on a net acreage, defined as 93% of gross orchard acreage for the purpose of this study. Harvest data were compared with yield prediction and presented as harvest prediction index, i.e. the ratio of predicted to harvested fruit yield. This harvest prediction index ranged between 0.7 and 1.2 over 3 years for three major apple cultivars Golden Delicious, Braeburn and Elstar. The image analysis software was optimised over the three years for the majority of fruit orchards with best results in the 25-50 t/ha yield range. The upper limit for the current image analysis software is 200 fruit/tree. Larger yields than 50 t/ha are under-estimated, because larger fruit loads on the tree resulted in overlapping fruit segments in the images with under-estimation of fruit number and yield; similarly, yields lower than 25 t/ha are over-estimated. Yield prediction was more accurate for early ripening than late-ripening apple cultivars due to the longer period between yield prediction and harvest and weather in between. Higher image resolution than 1.5 megapixel (Mpx) did not improve the accuracy of the yield prediction, but required more than 1 min for the fully automated image analysis of a single image. The accuracy of the yield prediction can be further improved by a larger number of photos per tree and fine tuning of the customised software, but not by higher resolution of the digital images vs. photos, which only slowed the process down. The vision or possible future of this informal initiative is a low-cost, still slow but efficient, fully (or largely) automated scheme, in which any fruit farmer in the world with an ordinary digital camera could participate at low cost with reasonable orchard records, if he follows simple instructions for the photography. The digital images could be posted or mailed via an FTP server for image analysis.ags:ARN="US201500070870" , 91089  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/91089_en.html , A field experiment was carried out in Northern Italy, within the frame of the EU project SAFIR, to test the feasibility of partial root-zone drying (PRD) irrigation management in potatoes and to compare the PRD irrigation strategy with regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). PRD increased total and first class tuber yield by 4.7% compared to RDI. Tuber weight was significantly (P<0.05) higher in the average as compared with RDI (+14.9 g). In dry years, PRD produced significantly more starch and less reducing sugars than RDI, but this did not occur in the rainy year. Water and Nitrogen Use Efficiency (WUE, NUE) were similar between irrigation treatments. The income for each cubic meter of water or kg of nitrogen was highly variable and not statistically different between PRD and RDI. Crop gross margin per hectare shows a tendency to increase with PRD (average +256 euro ha-1), although not steadily and not sufficiently to overcome the higher irrigation system and management costs.ags:ARN="US201500070870" , 91089  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/91089_en.html , A field experiment was carried out in Northern Italy, within the frame of the EU project SAFIR, to test the feasibility of partial root-zone drying (PRD) irrigation management in potatoes and to compare the PRD irrigation strategy with regulated deficit irrigation (RDI).

WARBO is aimed at implementing large-scale use of artificial recharge in Italy where water directives still strongly limit its application. In this context, the Mereto recharge site was selected in the upper Fruili plain where the water availability is guaranteed during winter period by the Tagliamento and Ledra Rivers. An infiltration basin, about 5.5m deep and 45?7mwide, was built at Mereto in the early 2000s but the possibility of implementing the recharge has been allowed only very recently. The site is characterized by an elevation of 105m asl and the depth to the groundwater table averages 50m. Below a few meter-thick organic soil, the aquifer is composed by coarse deposits with an estimated thickness of 100m and an average vertical hydraulic conductivity on the order of 10??m/s. A ~0.1m/s infiltration flow has been preliminary estimated (corresponding to an infiltration rate of 60cm/h). Geophysical investigations (electrical resistivity tomography, high-resolution seismic surveys) together with infiltration and pumping tests have been carried out to characterize the vadose zone and the unconfined aquifer in the study area. Functional approaches and three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element numerical computations have been used to predict the effect of the artificial recharge. The results of these investigations will greatly reduce the hydrogeological knowledge gaps and will be used to fine tune the recharge program and to define the monitoring concept.

Among the unknowns are the effects of an increasing frequency of acute, short-lasting winter warming events. Such events can damage higher plants exposed to warm, then returning cold, temperatures after snow melt and it is not known how bryophytes and lichens, which are of considerable ecological importance in high-latitude ecosystems, are affected by such warming events. However, even physiological adaptations of these cryptogams to winter environments in general are poorly understood.Here we describe findings from a novel field experiment that uses heating from infrared lamps and soil warming cables to simulate acute mid-winter warming events in a sub-Arctic heath. In particular, we report the growing season responses of the dominant lichen, Peltigera aphthosa, and bryophyte, Hylocomium splendens, to warming events in three consecutive winters.While summertime photosynthetic performance of P. aphthosa was unaffected by the winter warming treatments, H. splendens showed significant reductions of net photosynthetic rates and growth rates (of up to 48% and 52% respectively). Negative effects were evident already during the summer following the first winter warming event.While the lichen develops without going through critical phenological stages during which vulnerable organs are produced, the moss has a seasonal rhythm, which includes initiation of growth of young, freeze-susceptible shoot apices in the early growing season; these might be damaged by breaking of dormancy during warm winter events.Synthesis. Different sensitivities of the bryophyte and lichen species were unexpected, and illustrate that very little is known about the winter ecology of bryophytes and lichens from cold biomes in general. In sharp contrast to summer warming experiments that show increased vascular plant biomass and reduced lichen biomass, these results demonstrate that acute climate events in mid-winter may be readily tolerated by lichens, in contrast to previously observed sensitivity of co-occurring dwarf shrubs, suggesting winter climate change may compensate for (or even reverse) predicted lichen declines resulting from summer warming.ags:ARN="AV2012074011" , 103895  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/103895_en.html , Climate change in northern high latitudes is predicted to be greater in winter rather than summer, yet little is known about the effects of winter climate change on northern ecosystems.

In order to better understand the response of continental ecosystems to paleoclimate changes in southern South America, we investigated the sedimentary record of Puyehue Lake, located in the western piedmont of the Andes in south-central Chile (40S). We analyzed the elemental (C, N) and stable isotopic (13C, 15N) composition of the sedimentary organic matter preserved in the lake and its watershed to estimate the relative changes in the sources of sedimentary organic carbon through space and time. The geochemical signature of the aquatic and terrestrial end-members was determined on samples of lake particulate organic matter (N/C: 0.130) and Holocene paleosols (N/C: 0.069), respectively. A simple mixing equation based on the N/C ratio of these end-members was then used to estimate the fraction of terrestrial carbon (T) preserved in the lake sediments. Our approach was validated using surface sediment samples, which show a strong relation between T and distance to the main rivers and to the shore. We further applied this equation to an 11.22 m long sediment core to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes in Puyehue Lake and its watershed during the last 17.9 kyr. Our data provide evidence for a first warming pulse at 17.3 cal kyr BP, which triggered a rapid increase in lake diatom productivity, lagging the start of a similar increase in sea surface temperature (SST) off Chile by 1500 years. This delay is best explained by the presence of a large glacier in the lake watershed, which delayed the response time of the terrestrial proxies and limited the concomitant expansion of the vegetation in the lake watershed (low T). A second warming pulse at 12.8 cal kyr BP is inferred from an increase in lake productivity and a major expansion of the vegetation in the lake watershed, demonstrating that the Puyehue glacier had considerably retreated from the watershed. This second warming pulse is synchronous with a 2C increase in SST off the coast of Chile, and its timing corresponds to the beginning of the Younger Dryas Chronozone. These results contribute to the mounting evidence that the climate in the mid-latitudes of the southern Hemisphere was warming during the Younger Dryas Chronozone, in agreement with the bipolar see-saw hypothesis.ags:ARN="AV20120150400" , 95952  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/95952_en.html , Since the last deglaciation, the mid-latitudes of the southern Hemisphere have undergone considerable environmental changes.

Our data provide evidence for a first warming pulse at 17.3 cal kyr BP, which triggered a rapid increase in lake diatom productivity, lagging the start of a similar increase in sea surface temperature (SST) off Chile by 1500 years. This delay is best explained by the presence of a large glacier in the lake watershed, which delayed the response time of the terrestrial proxies and limited the concomitant expansion of the vegetation in the lake watershed (low T). A second warming pulse at 12.8 cal kyr BP is inferred from an increase in lake productivity and a major expansion of the vegetation in the lake watershed, demonstrating that the Puyehue glacier had considerably retreated from the watershed. This second warming pulse is synchronous with a 2C increase in SST off the coast of Chile, and its timing corresponds to the beginning of the Younger Dryas Chronozone. These results contribute to the mounting evidence that the climate in the mid-latitudes of the southern Hemisphere was warming during the Younger Dryas Chronozone, in agreement with the bipolar see-saw hypothesis.ags:ARN="AV20120150400" , 109167  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/109167_en.html , Since the last deglaciation, the mid-latitudes of the southern Hemisphere have undergone considerable environmental changes. In order to better understand the response of continental ecosystems to paleoclimate changes in southern South America, we investigated the sedimentary record of Puyehue Lake, located in the western piedmont of the Andes in south-central Chile (40S). We analyzed the elemental (C, N) and stable isotopic (13C, 15N) composition of the sedimentary organic matter preserved in the lake and its watershed to estimate the relative changes in the sources of sedimentary organic carbon through space and time. The geochemical signature of the aquatic and terrestrial end-members was determined on samples of lake particulate organic matter (N/C: 0.130) and Holocene paleosols (N/C: 0.069), respectively. A simple mixing equation based on the N/C ratio of these end-members was then used to estimate the fraction of terrestrial carbon (T) preserved in the lake sediments. Our approach was validated using surface sediment samples, which show a strong relation between T and distance to the main rivers and to the shore.

The structure of the Caribbean plate and the subducting Atlantic plate was determined through a combined analysis of ocean bottom seismometer and multi-channel seismic data along a transect between 15N and 17N. A detailed analysis of a priori and a posteriori information of a Monte Carlo based tomography scheme with a subsequent structural evaluation by forward modeling are applied to a 2-d seismic profile south of Guadeloupe. The island arc crust of the Caribbean plate has an average thickness of 282 km and overrides the approximately 8 km thick late cretaceous (80 Ma) Atlantic crust. The island arc crust shows two distinct reflections, which are interpreted as an intracrustal and Moho discontinuity, respectively. To a depth of 40 km the Atlantic lithosphere subducts at an average angle of 40. The accretionary prism gains a thickness of more than 10 km and shows high energy attenuation in the middle prism. A backstop structure is imaged by a strong lateral increase of the vertical velocity gradient superimposed on structural heterogeneities. The decollement zone reaches a thickness of up to 1.8 km and shows no seismic phase polarity change. The slow convergence rate and the subduction of the Tiburon and Barracuda ridges make this subduction zone a prime candidate for major earthquakes. Between 15N and 17N, the seismogenic rupture area is approximated by the contact zone between the backstop and the mantle wedge. Accordingly, this area is capable of triggering an earthquake of a magnitude of Mw 7.6 and indeed makes this active European subduction zone a place of major telluric risk.ags:ARN="AV2012076147" , 100541  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100541_en.html , In the context of the EU funded THALES project active seismic investigations were conducted along the Lesser Antilles subduction zone, using both, wide-angle and near-vertical techniques.

This protocol provides specific instructions on the sampling strategy, the use of questionnaires, and collection of blood samples for immunological analyses. The surveys were performed as multi-centre, cross-sectional studies in general populations. Case-control studies were nested within these surveys. The studies in children aged 7-10 years and adults aged 20-54 years were undertaken in eight centres representing different social and climatic regions in Europe. After a community-based survey collecting basic information on adverse reactions to foods, all those stating they had experienced such reactions, as well as of a random sample of those stating 'no reactions' to foods, completed a detailed questionnaire on potential risks and exposures. Also a blood sample was taken to allow serological analysis to establish patterns of food and aeroallergen sensitization. We also included a questionnaire to schools on their preparedness for dealing with food allergy amongst pupils. Subjects reporting adverse reactions to foods and sensitized to the same food(s) were called in for a full clinical evaluation that included a double blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), following a protocol which is described in detail elsewhere.

Some members of this genus have a quarantine status, and accurate species identification is required to prevent further spreading. DNA barcoding is a method for organism identification in non-complex DNA backgrounds based on informative motifs in short DNA stretches (?600? bp). As part of the EU 7th Framework project QBOL, 15 Meloidogyne species were chosen to compare the resolutions offered by two typical DNA barcoding loci, COI and COII, with the distinguishing signals produced by two ribosomal DNA genes (small and large subunit rDNA; SSU???1,700 and LSU???3,400? bp). None of the four markers distinguished between the tropical species Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica and M. arenaria. Taking P ID (Liberal) values ?0.93 as a measure for species delimitation, the four mtDNA and rDNA markers performed well for the tropical Meloidogyne species complex, M. enterolobii, M. hapla, and M. maritima. Within cluster III A (Holterman et al. Phytopathology, 99, 227235, 2009), SSU rDNA did not offer resolution at species level. Both mtDNA loci COI and COII did, whereas for LSU rDNA a longer fragment (?700? bp) is required. The high level of mitochondrial heteroplasmy recently reported for M. chitwoodi (Humphreys-Pereira and Elling Nematology, 15, 315327, 2013) was not found in the populations under investigation, suggesting this could be a regional phenomenon. For identification of RKNs, we suggest the combined use of SSU rDNA with one of three other markers presented here.ags:ARN="US201301845565" , 88212  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/88212_en.html , Background, aim and scope The paper presents concentrations of trace elements in blood of homebred animals (cows and sheep) from Southern Serbia (Bujanovac) and the contents of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides and some heavy metals in feed. The region of Southern Serbia was exposed to contamination by depleted uranium ammunition during NATO attacks in 1999 and therefore, is of great concern to environmental pollution and human and animal health. Materials and methods Conventional instrumental and epithermal neutron activation analyses are used to measure trace elements in cow and sheep blood samples collected randomly at six locations in the region of Bujanovac (village of Borovac) in the spring of 2005. Samples of feed (grass and crops: corn, wheat and oats), collected on the same locations (households), are analysed for the contents of radionuclides on an HPGe detector (Ortec, relative efficiency 23%) by standard gamma spectrometry. The content of Hg, Pb and Cd in feed is determined by standard atomic absorption spectrometry on the VarianSpectra220/ThermoSolar GFS97 spectrometer. Results Concentrations of 29 elements (Na, Al (P), Cl, K, Sc, Cr, Mn, Ni, Fe, Co, Zn, Se, As, Br, Sr, Rb, Sb, In, I, Ba, Cs, La, Nd, Eu, Sm, Tb, Hf, Ta and Th) are determined in blood of the examined animals. In feeds, natural ??K is found in all of the samples, cosmogenic ?Be and fission product ??Cs are detected only in the grass samples, while heavy metals Hg, Cd and Pb are found in the range of 0.01-0.02, 0.84-1.15 and 0.74-7.34 mg/kg, respectively. Calculated soil-to-blood transfer factors are in a wide range of 810?? to 64, as a result of varying significance of the elements in animal metabolism and feeding habits. Discussion The results of trace elements' concentrations in animal blood are in good agreement with available data for K, Ni, Zn, Se and Rb. Higher Br concentrations in animal blood are most probably caused by large biomass burning events during blood sampling. Very low concentration of Fe in cows and sheep confirms the results of previous biochemical studies on animal anaemia in the region. High concentration of As correlates with geochemical peculiarities of the Balkans and is also likely influenced by the use of pesticides in the agricultural production. For some of the elements (La, Nd, Eu, Sm, Tb, Sb, Hf, Ta, Th, In, Ba, Sr, Sc and Cs), there are few or no literature data. Therefore, some of the presented data are significant not only for the country and the region, but on a wider scale. Activities of natural radionuclides in feeds are within the average values reported for the region, while the activities of ??Pb and ?/?U are below the limit of detection. This is in accordance with previous investigations showing no widespread contamination by depleted uranium in the area. Contents of Hg and Pb in feeds are below the nationally permissible levels, unlike the content of Cd which exceeds it, probably caused by the use of phosphate fertilisers and fossil fuel combustion in the area. Conclusions In general, the concentrations of trace elements in blood of homebred cows and sheep are in good agreement with reference materials, available literature data and the results of previous studies in the area. The exceptions are Fe, As and Br. The contents of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides in feeds are within the expected levels, and there are no signs of contamination by depleted uranium or other fission products.

Apart from Cd, there are no signs of pollution by heavy metals in feeds. The highly sensitive method of instrumental neutron activation analysis provides data on the concentration of some elements in animal blood not previously reported for the region and elsewhere. Recommendations and perspectives The presented study is a part of the long term ongoing project on the health risk assessment on animals and humans in the region. The collected data is intended to provide a base for the animal and human risk assessment as well as an estimate of the general pollution status of the environment in the region. Since some of the investigated elements are classified as important trace elements for livestock, the results could also be used to balance and improve the animal diet and thus, improve the growth and reproduction rate.ags:ARN="DJ2012084778" , 95053  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/95053_en.html , <span style="font-family: GaramondThree; font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: GaramondThree; font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: GaramondThree; font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: GaramondThree; font-size: xx-small;"><p align="left">The information about pathogens excreted by semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) that might represent a health risk to humans and animals is insufficient. The objectives of this study are to find the occurrence and prevalence of important potentially enteropathogenic, zoonotic bacteria and parasites in reindeer. Faecal samples from clinically healthy, semi-domesticated reindeer (n=2243) from northern regions of Finland and Norway were examined for important potentially enteropathogenic bacteria (Campylobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp.) and parasites (Cryptosporidium spp.) following standard procedures. Escherichia coli were isolated in 2123 (94.7%), Enterococcus spp. in 2084 (92.9%), Yersinia spp. in 108 (4.8%) samples and Campylobacter sp., identified as C. hyointestinalis, in one sample only (0.04%). Neither Salmonella spp. nor Cryptosporidium-oocysts were detected. This study clearly shows that E. coli and Enterococcus spp. belong to the normal intestinal flora of healthy reindeer. However, only few of the isolated E. coli-strains possess genes encoding stx1 (0.14%), stx2 (0%), eae (0.52%) and hlyEHEC (0.99%), detected by PCR, that have the ability to cause health problems in humans and also animals. The isolated Yersinia spp. were further analysed for virulence factors, but examinations revealed no pathogenic strains. The public health risk due to excretion of important enteropathogenic microorganisms from reindeer has to be considered very low at present but a putative epidemiological threat to human health might arise when herding conditions are changed towards intensification and crowding.

Within the EU-project SAFIR new water-saving irrigation strategies were developed based on pot, semi-field and field experiments with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and processing tomatoes as model plants. From the pot and semi-field experiments an ABA production model was developed for potatoes to optimize the ABA signalling; this was obtained by modelling the optimal level of soil drying for ABA production before re-irrigation in a crop growth model. The field irrigation guidelines were developed under temperate (Denmark), Mediterranean (Greece, Italy) and continental (Serbia, China) climatic conditions during summer. The field investigations on processing tomatoes were undertaken only in the Po valley (North Italy) on fine, textured soil. The investigations from several studies showed that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation (DI) or partial root zone drying irrigation (PRD) induced hydraulic and chemical signals from the root system resulting in partial stomatal closure, an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency, and a slight reduction in top vegetative growth. Further PRD increased N-mineralization significantly beyond that from DI, causing a stay-green effect late in the growing season. In field potato and tomato experiments the water-saving irrigation strategies DI and PRD were able to save about 20-30% of the water used in fully irrigated plants. PRD increased marketable yield in potatoes significantly by 15% due to improved tuber size distribution. PRD increased antioxidant content significantly by approximately 10% in both potatoes and fresh tomatoes. Under a high temperature regime, full irrigation (FI) should be undertaken, as was clear from field observations in tomatoes. For tomatoes full irrigation should be undertaken for cooling effects when the night/day average temperature >26.5C or when air temperature >40C to avoid flower-dropping. The temperature threshold for potatoes is not clear. From three-year field drip irrigation experiments we found that under the establishment phase, both potatoes and tomatoes should be fully irrigated; however, during the later phases deficit irrigation might be applied as outlined below without causing significant yield reduction:  Potatoes ? After the end of tuber initiation, DI or PRD is applied at 70% of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50% of FI.  Fresh tomatoes ? From the moment the 1st truce is developed, DI is applied at 85-80% of FI for two weeks. In the middle period, DI or PRD is applied at 70% of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50% of FI.  Processing tomatoes ? From transplanting to fruit setting at 4th-5th cluster, the PRD and DI threshold for re-irrigation is when the plant-available soil water content (ASWC) equals 0.7 (soil water potential,  soil =?90kPa). During the late fruit development/ripening stage, 10% of red fruits, the threshold for re-irrigation for DI is when ASWC=0.5 ( soil =?185kPa) and for PRD when ASWC (dry side)=0.4 ( soil, dry side =?270kPa).

Within the EU-project SAFIR new water-saving irrigation strategies were developed based on pot, semi-field and field experiments with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and processing tomatoes as model plants. From the pot and semi-field experiments an ABA production model was developed for potatoes to optimize the ABA signalling; this was obtained by modelling the optimal level of soil drying for ABA production before re-irrigation in a crop growth model. The field irrigation guidelines were developed under temperate (Denmark), Mediterranean (Greece, Italy) and continental (Serbia, China) climatic conditions during summer. The field investigations on processing tomatoes were undertaken only in the Po valley (North Italy) on fine, textured soil. The investigations from several studies showed that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation (DI) or partial root zone drying irrigation (PRD) induced hydraulic and chemical signals from the root system resulting in partial stomatal closure, an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency, and a slight reduction in top vegetative growth. Further PRD increased N-mineralization significantly beyond that from DI, causing a stay-green effect late in the growing season. In field potato and tomato experiments the water-saving irrigation strategies DI and PRD were able to save about 20-30% of the water used in fully irrigated plants. PRD increased marketable yield in potatoes significantly by 15% due to improved tuber size distribution. PRD increased antioxidant content significantly by approximately 10% in both potatoes and fresh tomatoes. Under a high temperature regime, full irrigation (FI) should be undertaken, as was clear from field observations in tomatoes. For tomatoes full irrigation should be undertaken for cooling effects when the night/day average temperature >26.5C or when air temperature >40C to avoid flower-dropping. The temperature threshold for potatoes is not clear. From three-year field drip irrigation experiments we found that under the establishment phase, both potatoes and tomatoes should be fully irrigated; however, during the later phases deficit irrigation might be applied as outlined below without causing significant yield reduction:  Potatoes ? After the end of tuber initiation, DI or PRD is applied at 70% of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50% of FI.  Fresh tomatoes ? From the moment the 1st truce is developed, DI is applied at 85-80% of FI for two weeks. In the middle period, DI or PRD is applied at 70% of FI.

During the late fruit development/ripening stage, 10% of red fruits, the threshold for re-irrigation for DI is when ASWC=0.5 ( soil =?185kPa) and for PRD when ASWC (dry side)=0.4 ( soil, dry side =?270kPa). The findings during the SAFIR project might be used as a framework for implementing water-saving deficit irrigation under different local soil and climatic conditions.ags:ARN="US201301919754" , 110293  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110293_en.html , Agriculture is a big consumer of fresh water in competition with other sectors of the society. Within the EU-project SAFIR new water-saving irrigation strategies were developed based on pot, semi-field and field experiments with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and processing tomatoes as model plants. From the pot and semi-field experiments an ABA production model was developed for potatoes to optimize the ABA signalling; this was obtained by modelling the optimal level of soil drying for ABA production before re-irrigation in a crop growth model. The field irrigation guidelines were developed under temperate (Denmark), Mediterranean (Greece, Italy) and continental (Serbia, China) climatic conditions during summer. The field investigations on processing tomatoes were undertaken only in the Po valley (North Italy) on fine, textured soil. The investigations from several studies showed that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation (DI) or partial root zone drying irrigation (PRD) induced hydraulic and chemical signals from the root system resulting in partial stomatal closure, an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency, and a slight reduction in top vegetative growth. Further PRD increased N-mineralization significantly beyond that from DI, causing a stay-green effect late in the growing season. In field potato and tomato experiments the water-saving irrigation strategies DI and PRD were able to save about 20-30% of the water used in fully irrigated plants. PRD increased marketable yield in potatoes significantly by 15% due to improved tuber size distribution. PRD increased antioxidant content significantly by approximately 10% in both potatoes and fresh tomatoes. Under a high temperature regime, full irrigation (FI) should be undertaken, as was clear from field observations in tomatoes. For tomatoes full irrigation should be undertaken for cooling effects when the night/day average temperature >26.5C or when air temperature >40C to avoid flower-dropping. The temperature threshold for potatoes is not clear. From three-year field drip irrigation experiments we found that under the establishment phase, both potatoes and tomatoes should be fully irrigated; however, during the later phases deficit irrigation might be applied as outlined below without causing significant yield reduction:  Potatoes ? After the end of tuber initiation, DI or PRD is applied at 70% of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50% of FI.  Fresh tomatoes ? From the moment the 1st truce is developed, DI is applied at 85-80% of FI for two weeks. In the middle period, DI or PRD is applied at 70% of FI.

The aim of this study is to investigate the seasonal and spatial variance of organic micropollutants in small fresh water streams and to identify possible sources and sinks. Therefore four small freshwater river systems in Hesse, Germany, have been investigated with respect to common organic pollutants such as: the organophosphates tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP), the synthetic musk fragrances 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexa-methylcyclopenta-[g]-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN),  the endocrine disruptors bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and the technical isomer mixture of 4-nonylphenol (NP), the herbicide terbutryn [2-(t-butylamino)-4-(ethylamino)-6-(methylthio)-s-triazine] as well as the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). Water samples were collected in the time span from September 2003 to September 2006 at 26 sampling locations. The samples were extracted with solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For quantification the internal standard method was used. The results of the study showed an ubiquitous occurrence of organic pollutants in the fresh water streams of the study area. The organophosphates have been detected in 90 % of the water samples with mean concentrations of 502 ng/l (TCPP), 276 ng/l (TBP), 183 ng/l (TBEP), 118 ng/l (TCEP) and 117 ng/l (TDCPP). Sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents were identified as the dominating source for the chlorinated organophosphates as well as for the synthetic musk fragrances and the insect repellent DEET in the river systems. Consequently the highest concentrations were observed in the Schwarzbach system characterized by the highest proportion of waste water compared to the other river systems. Mean concentration levels of the synthetic musk fragrances HHCB and ATHN were 141 ng/l and 46 ng/l, respectively and 124 ng/l in case of DEET.  The synthetic musk fragrances showed a clear seasonal trend with significantly lower concentrations in summer times compared to winter times, which is ascribed to stronger photodegradation and volatization during summer times. In contrast, mean DEET concentrations and loads were significantly higher in summer than in autumn, winter and spring, in parallel with the main insect season.The concentrations of the endocrine disruptors BPA, NP and OP in the river water samples ranged from <20 ng/l to 1927 ng/l, <10 ng/l to 770 ng/l, and <10 ng/l to 420 ng/l, respectively. Whereas OP was present in about 2/3 of the samples, NP and BPA could only be detected in 56% and 13% of the water samples, respectively. BPA levels exceeded in two samples the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for water organisms. In case of NP, highest concentrations and loads were found in September 2003 and decreased significantly since then. In contrast, concentrations and loads of OP which serves in a similar application field remained nearly constant during the sampling period.  The decrease of NP can be attributed to the implementation of the European Directive 2003/53/EG, which restricts the use of nonylphenols and nonylphenol ethoxylates since January 2005. However, at the end of the sampling period in September 2006, NP could still be detected at mean concentrations of 18 ng/l in the river waters of the sampling area. Furthermore, absence of NP in several samples from associated STP effluents indicate that the STPs cannot be the only sources for NP found in the river water.The herbicide terbutryn was present in the rivers during the whole sampling period from September 2003 to September 2006 despite a ban on its use as a herbicide from January 2004 on. Terbutryn levels ranged from < 4 ng/l to 5600 ng/l, showing a clear spatial pattern with high terbutryn concentrations in the Weschnitz and Modau river systems and significantly lower terbutryn levels in Schwarzbach and Winkelbach. Results from the analysis of two STP effluents discharging into the Weschnitz and the Modau, respectively, indicate that terbutryn enters the rivers from this source. Furthermore, terbutryn concentrations and loads showed a clear seasonal trend with significantly higher levels in summer and autumn. Obviously, the ban on agricultural use of terbutryn at the end of 2003 had no discernable influence on terbutryn concentration in the rivers because there was no trend of decreasing.ags:ARN="AV20120164578" , 187020  project url: http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/187020_en.html , The present study was elaborated within the scope of the INTAFERE (Integrated Analysis of Mobile Organic Foreign Substances in Rivers) project which investigates the occurrence of xenobiotics in small freshwater streams with particular consideration of social impact factors.
